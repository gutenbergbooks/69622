  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Illustrations of Belief in Magic in Mediæval and in Early Modern Times</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Even a slight acquaintance with European history reveals
the existence of a number of curious and apparently
unreasonable beliefs prevalent throughout a period extending
from early mediæval to comparatively recent times.
There is the belief in witchcraft, for instance. From the
canons of synods in the early Middle Ages down to the
pitiless executions during the witchcraft delusion, there is
abundant evidence of its prominence. It played its part not
only in humble life, but in court intrigues and in the accusations
brought at state trials.</p>

<p class='c010'>The belief that one’s future could be learned by observing
the stars was equally widespread. Astrologers throve at the
courts of kings, and sometimes their advice was taken even
by him whose every act was held to be under special divine
direction. It would be a great mistake to think that the
astrologer was maintained merely for the amusement of
king and court, like the jester. His utterances were taken
most seriously, and the principles of his art were so generally
accepted as to become the commonplaces of the thought
and the conversation of daily life. In 1305, for instance,
when certain cardinals urged Pope Clement V to
return to Rome, they reminded him that every planet was
most powerful in its own house.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Indeed, even in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>speech to-day numerous vestiges of the astrological art survive.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, a grander and more imposing witchcraft displayed
itself in the stories of the wizard Merlin and in the
persons of the wicked magicians with whom knights contended
in the pages of mediæval romance. So strong was
the tendency to believe in the marvelous, that men of learning
were often pictured by subsequent tradition, if not by
contemporary gossip, as mighty necromancers. Even Gerbert,
who seems to have done nothing more shocking than
to write a treatise on the abacus and build a pipe-organ,
was pictured as running off with a magician’s book and
daughter, hanging under bridges between earth and water
to escape noxious spells, and making compacts with Satan.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The attitude of the average mind as it has just been illustrated
was to a large extent characteristic of the best instructed
and most widely read men. The erudite poet Dante
accepted the influence of the constellations upon human destiny.
Bodin maintained in his <cite>Republic</cite>—perhaps the greatest
book on political science written during the sixteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>century—that astrology was very useful in tracing the development
of society.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Aquinas, chief of the mediæval theologians,
accepted astrological theory, except as limited by
human free will, and further admitted that most men make
little use of their liberty of action but blindly follow their
passions, which are governed by the stars.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Among other
great mediæval churchmen and canonists, d’Ailly and Gerson
both believed that God signified important events in
advance through the stars, and d’Ailly made some astrological
predictions himself. Astrology was much taught in the
mediæval universities,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and was regarded as the climax of
mathematics and as an essential part of medicine.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is with such beliefs, accepted by educated men and
forming a part of the learning and science of the times, that
we are concerned in this essay. First, it is necessary to give
some further evidence of the nature and of the general acceptance
of these beliefs. This object will be most quickly
and effectively secured by a résumé of the views of a few
of the men most prominent in the intellectual history of the
past. These men should offer fair, if not flattering, illustrations
of the learning and culture of their times. In
especial we shall notice the curious notions of those who
wrote on scientific subjects or showed even a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>approach towards the modern scientific spirit. This we shall
do partly because their writings seem at first thought the
place where we should least expect to find such notions, and
hence furnish striking illustration of the almost universal
acceptance of these beliefs; partly because, as we shall soon
find reason to conclude, there is really some connection between
such beliefs and science.</p>

<p class='c010'>The early Middle Ages are not distinguished for the
prevalence of education and of culture in Latin Christendom,
to say nothing of profound knowledge or original
thought in any particular branch of learning. But in such
learning and science as there was may be found examples of
the beliefs which we wish to consider. We see them in Isidore
of Seville, whose <cite>Etymologies</cite>, we may well believe,
constituted an oft-consulted encyclopedia in many a monastic
library for several centuries after the seventh, when it
appeared. This saint, like almost all good Christians of
his day, believed that marvels could be effected through
magic by the aid of demons, although such resort to evil
spirits he could not condemn too strongly.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> But he saw no
harm in holding that certain stones possess astonishing
powers,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> that the dog-star afflicts bodies with disease, and
that the appearance of a comet signifies pestilence, famine
or war.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> He maintained that it was no waste of time to look
into the meaning of the numbers which occur in the Bible.
He thought that they might reveal many sacred mysteries.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Bede expressed similar views in his scientific treatises.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Also, if we may regard as his two little essays about the
authenticity of which there is some question, he ascribed
such extraordinary influence to the moon as to maintain that
the practice of bleeding should be regulated by its phases,
and wrote—with some hesitation lest he should be accused
of magic—an explanation of how to predict coming disasters
by observing the time and direction of peals of thunder.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Passing over several centuries during which judicial
astrology is very conspicuous in the mathematical treatises
which formed the greater part of the scientific literature of
the times,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> we come at the close of the twelfth century to
the <cite>De Naturis Rerum</cite> of Alexander Neckam (1157–1217).
We find him ecstatically musing over the consonance of
celestial harmony and associating the seven planets with the
seven liberal arts and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
as if believing that there is some occult virtue in that number
or some potent sympathy between these material bodies
and such abstractions as branches of learning and generic
virtues. Descending from the skies to things earthly—the
transition is easy since he believes in the influence, saving
human free will, of the planets on our lower creation<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>tells us that mug-wort prevents the traveler from feeling
fatigue,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and that the Egyptian fig makes the wrinkles of
old age vanish and can tame the fiercest bulls once they are
gathered beneath its branches.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> He describes fountains
with properties as marvelous as those of the herb or of the
tree.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> He tells of stones which, placed on the head of the
sleeping wife, provoke confession of marital infidelity,<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a> or
which, extracted from the crop of a rooster and carried in
one’s mouth, give victory in war.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> What is more, words
as well as plants and stones are found by the careful and
industrious investigator of nature to have great virtue, as
experiment shows beyond doubt.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Neckam, despite the fact that according to his editor,
Thomas Wright, he “not infrequently displays a taste for
experimental science,”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> was, after all, more of a moralizing
compiler than anything else. But greater men than
Neckam, men who were interested in learning and science
for their own sake, men who knew more and wrote more,
still cherished beliefs of the same sort. There was Michael
Scot in the early years of the thirteenth century, the wonder
of the cultured court of Frederick II, perhaps that monarch’s
tutor, the “Supreme Master” of Paris, the man
who helped much to make the treasures of learning amassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>by the Arabs in Spain the common property of Latin Christendom,
the introducer to Western Europe of a Latin version
of Averroes and of an enlarged Aristotle.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Scot composed
a primer of astrology for young scholars. His writings
on alchemy show that he experimented in it not a
little. His <cite>Physionomia</cite> accepts the doctrine of signatures,
tells us that these signs on the outward body of the soul’s
inner state are often discovered through dreams, and contains
a chapter giving an extended description of the rules
of augury—an art on which the author, though a Christian,
apparently bestowed his sanction. Prophetic verses foretelling
the fate of several Italian cities have come down to
us under his name. A poem of Henri d’Avranches, written
in 1235–6, recalls to mind the fact that certain prophecies
concerning the emperor had been made by the then deceased
Michael Scot, whom the poet proceeds to call a scrutinizer
of the stars, an augur, a soothsayer, a <i><span lang="la">veridicus vates</span></i>, and
a second Apollo.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> A most interesting recipe for invoking
demons to instruct one in liberal arts is attributed to
Michael Scot in a manuscript collection of <cite>Occulta</cite> in the
Laurentian library.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Later in the same century stands forth the famous figure
of Roger Bacon, the stout defender of mathematics and
physics against scholasticism. Some have ascribed to him
numerous important innovations in the realm of natural
science and of the mechanical arts, and have regarded his
promulgation of the experimental method, guided by the
mathematical method, as the first herald note of that modern
science which was not destined really to appear for yet several
centuries. Yet he held that the alchemist, if given
sufficient time and money, could discover a way not only to
meet the state’s expenses by converting baser metals into
gold, but also to prolong human existence beyond that limit
to which it can be drawn out by nature.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Indeed these objects
constituted two of the three examples he gave of the
great advantages to be gained from the pursuit of that experimental
science which was to disprove and blot out all
magical nonsense.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>How far Bacon let the principles of astrology carry him
a citation or two will show. That a woman had succeeded
in living twenty years without eating was, he explained, no
miracle, but due to the fact that during that period some
constellation was able to reduce the concourse of the four
elements in her body to a greater degree of harmony than
they usually attain.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Nor is it health alone that the stars
control; they affect human character.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> They implant in the
babe at birth good or evil dispositions, great or small talents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Human free will may either better these innate tendencies
through God’s grace or modify them for the worse
by yielding to Satan’s temptings; but in general the stars
so far prevail that there are different laws and customs and
national traits under different quarters of the heavens.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
Nay more, astrology offers proof of the superiority of Christianity
to other religions and gives insight into the nature
of Antichrist.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As one might surmise from Bacon’s belief in the potent
effect of sidereal emanations, he makes much of the theory
that every agent sends forth its own virtue and species into
external matter. This leads him to accept fascination as a
fact. Just as Aristotle tells that in some localities mares
become pregnant by the mere odor of the stallions, and as
Pliny relates that the basilisk kills by a glance, so the witch
by the vapor from her bleary eye draws her victims on to
destruction. In short, “Man can project virtue and species
outside himself, the more since he is nobler than all corporeal
things, and especially because of the virtue of the rational
soul.”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Hence the great effects possible from spoken words
or written characters; although one must beware of falling
into the absurdities and abominations of the magicians.
Bacon, moreover, was like Scot a believer in the doctrine
of signatures.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Other men of the same period prominent in science who
held similar beliefs we can scarcely stop to mention. There
was Vincent de Beauvais, the great encyclopedist, and Bernard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Gordon, a physician of Montpellier and a medical
writer of considerable note, who nevertheless recommended
the use of a magic formula for the treatment of epilepsy.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
There was Albertus Magnus with his trust in such wonderful
powers of stones as to cure ulcers, counteract potions,
conciliate human hearts, and win battles; and his theory
that ligatures and suspensions, and gems carved with proper
images possess similar strange virtues.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> There was Arnald
of Villanova who propounded such admirable doctrines as
that a physician ought first of all to understand the chief
functions of life and chief organs of the body and that the
science of particular things is the foundation of all knowledge,
and yet who believed in astrological medicine, wrote
on oneiromancy and interpreted dreams, translated treatises
on incantations, ligatures and other magic devices, and composed
a book on the <cite>Tetragrammaton</cite> or ineffable name of
Jehovah.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>That marvelous power of words—especially of the divine
names of angels and of the Supreme Deity—which we may
suppose Arnald to have touched upon in his <cite>Tetragrammaton</cite>,
was discussed at length by a series of scholars at the
close of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century
whose names are most familiar to the student of those
times. These men pushed the practice of allegorical interpretation
of sacred writings, which had been in constant
vogue among religious and theological writers from the days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of the early Christian Fathers, to the extreme of discovering
sublime secrets not only by regarding every incident
and object in Scripture as a parable, but by treating the
text itself as a cryptogram. Not only, like Isidore, did they
see in every numerical measurement in the Bible mystic
meaning, but in the very letters they doubted not there was
hidden that knowledge by which one might gain control of
all the processes of the universe; nay, penetrate through
the ten sephiroth to the unspeakable and infinite source of
all. For our visible universe is but the reflected image of
an invisible, and each has subtle and practically unlimited
power over the other. The key to that power is words.
Such were the doctrines held by Pico Della Mirandola
(1463–1494) who asserted that no science gave surer proof
of Christ’s divinity than magical and cabalistic science;<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
such were the doctrines of the renowned humanist, John
Reuchlin, who connected letters in the sacred text with individual
angels;<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> of Henry Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535)
who, inspired by Reuchlin’s <cite>De verbo mirifico</cite> and <cite>De arte
cabalistica</cite>, declared that whoever knew the true pronunciation
of the name Jehovah had “the world in his mouth;”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
of Trithemius from whom Paracelsus is said to have acquired
the “Cabala of the spiritual, astral and material
worlds.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the writings of men primarily devoted to
science continued through the sixteenth and on into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>seventeenth century to contain much the same occult theories
that Michael Scot, Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus
had accepted and discussed. Jerome Cardan, one of the
most prominent men of his time in mathematics and medicine—indeed,
the discoverer of new processes in the former
science—nevertheless believed in a strong attraction and
sympathy between the heavenly bodies and our own, cast
horoscopes and wrote on judicial astrology. In his <cite>Arithmetic</cite>
he treated of the marvelous properties of certain
numbers; in other writings he credulously discussed demons,
ghosts, incantations, divination and chiromancy. His thirteen
books on metoposcopy explain how to tell a person’s
character, ability and destiny by a minute examination of
the lines on different portions of the body and by warts.
He owned a selenite which he believed prevented sleep and
a jacinth to which he attributed an opposite influence.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The vagaries of Paracelsus are notorious, and yet he was
far more than a mere quack. Tycho Brahe (1546–1601)
was a faithful follower of experimental method. He saw
that the science of the stars could amount to little unless
based on a mass of correct observations, and was one of
the first to devote his life to that foundation of patient and
systematic drudgery on which the great structure of modern
science is being reared. His painstaking endeavor to have
accurate instruments and his care to make allowance for
possible error were the marks, rare enough in those days,
of the true scientist. Yet he made many an astrological
prognostication, and was, as his biographer puts it, “a
perfect son of the sixteenth century, believing the universe
to be woven together by mysterious connecting
threads which the contemplation of the stars or of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>elements of nature might unravel, and thereby lift the veil
of the future.”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> He also dabbled in alchemy, believed in
relations of occult sympathy between “the ethereal and
elementary worlds,” and filled his mind with the teachings
of Hermes Trismegistus, Geber, Arnald of Villanova, Raymond
Lullius, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, even Francis Bacon, famed as the draughtsman
of the chart which henceforth guided explorers in the
domain of science, thought that there was considerable value
in physiognomy and the interpretation of natural dreams,
though the superstition and phantasies of later ages had
debased those subjects;<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and in divination if not “conducted
by blind authority.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a> He said that by a reformed
astrology one might predict plagues, famines, wars, seditions,
sects, great human migrations and “all great disturbances
or innovations in both natural and civil affairs.”<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such are the beliefs which for a long time pervaded the
thought and learning of Europe; beliefs of the widespread
acceptance of which we have noted but a few striking illustrations.
They constitute a varied and formidable class of
convictions. There was the notion that from such things
as the marks upon one’s body, or from one’s dreams, or
from peals of thunder, flight of birds, entrails of sacrificial
victims and the movements of the stars, we can foretell the
future. There was the assumption that certain precious
stones, certain plants and trees and fountains, certain animals
or parts of animals have strange and wonderful virtues.
There was the idea that man, too, possesses marvelous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>powers to the extent that he can fascinate and bewitch
his fellows. Nor should we forget the attribution to the
heavenly bodies of an enormous influence over minerals
and vegetation, over human health and character, over
national constitutions and customs, even over religious
movements. We find this notion of occult virtue extended
to things without physical reality: to words, to numbers,
to written characters and formulæ. It is applied to certain
actions and ways of doing things: to “ligatures and suspensions,”
for instance. Then there was the belief that
wonders may be wrought by the aid of demons, and that
incantations, suffumigations, and the like are of great value
in invoking spirits. Finally, there was a vague general
notion that not only are the ethereal and elementary worlds
joined by occult sympathy, but that all parts of the universe
are somehow mystically connected, and that perhaps a single
magic key may be discovered by which we may become
masters of the entire universe.</p>

<p class='c010'>How shall we classify these beliefs? What shall we call
them? What is their meaning, what their origin and
cause? As for classification, it is easy to suggest names
which partially apply to some of these notions, or adequately
characterize them individually. The art of signatures,
oneiromancy, augury, divination, astrology, alchemy,
the Cabala, sorcery, and necromancy are some designations
which at once come to mind. But no one of them is at all
adequate as a class name for all these beliefs and the practices
which they involve, taken together. Are not these
notions, nevertheless, closely allied; is there not an intimate
relation between them all? And is not “magic” a
term which will include them all and denote the general
subject, the philosophy and the art, of which they all are
branches?</p>

<p class='c010'>True, many of the holders of the beliefs above enumerated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>declaimed against “magic.”<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> But sometimes fear of
being accused of magic was their very reason for so doing.
Bede had such a fear when he treated of divination by
thunder. Roger Bacon took suspicious care to insist that
his theories had nothing to do with magic, which he declared
was for the most part a mere pretense and could
bring marvels to pass only by diabolical assistance.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The
writer of the <cite>Speculum Astronomiae</cite>—probably Albertus
Magnus—found it necessary to write a treatise to distinguish
books of necromancy from works on “astronomy,”
<em>i. e.</em>, astrology.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Coming to a later age, we find Agrippa
frankly owning his trust in magic, and including under it,
in his three books of <cite>Occult Philosophy</cite>, practically all the
beliefs that we have mentioned. For him magic embraced
the fields of nature, mathematics and theology. Indeed,
men of his day and of the century following displayed a
tendency to stretch the term to include true science. He
himself called magic “the acme of all philosophy.” Giovanni
Battista della Porta (1540–1615), not it is true without
considerable justification, called his encyclopedic work on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>nature <cite>Natural Magic</cite>.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Lord Bacon chose to understand
magic “in its ancient and honorable significance” among
the Persians as “a sublimer wisdom or a knowledge of
universal nature.” He said that as physics, investigating
efficient and material causes, produced mechanics, so metaphysics,
studying into forms, produced magic.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Apparently, then, magic has a broad significance and a
long history. The word itself takes us back to the Magi
of ancient Persia; the thing it represents is older yet. It
will form the theme of our next chapter, where we shall
discuss its history and its meaning, and then the particular
significance of those beliefs accepted by men of learning
which have been enumerated in the present chapter.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Magic: Its Origins and Relations to Science</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To men of the past—how long ago does not at present
matter—magic meant far more than the performance for
their amusement of clever tricks, which however puzzling
they knew well enough were based upon illusion and deception.
There was a real magic for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>This faith in the reality of magic was not, moreover,
merely the outcome of men’s belief in the existence of evil
spirits, in the power of those spirits to work changes in
matter or to predict the future, and in man’s power to gain
their services. We sometimes speak of magic and necromancy
as if they were identical, and mediæval writers often
did the same thing, but such is not the case. If we but consider
the meaning of the word “magic” when used as an
adjective, we perceive that thus to restrict its scope as a
noun is incorrect. What is a magic cloak, for instance?
It is simply a cloak possessing properties which cloaks in
general do not possess and which we are surprised to find
in cloaks. Most cloaks keep us warm or improve our personal
appearance; this cloak makes us invulnerable and invisible.
A demon or a fairy may have endowed the cloak
with these extraordinary qualities, but that is a secondary
consideration. What makes the garment a magic cloak is
the fact that it has such properties, no matter where or how
it got them. Or what is a magic change? Is it merely a
change wrought by spirits good or evil? By no means.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>It is any change with characteristics and results which we
do not expect nor usually see in changes. In short, magic
is præternatural rather than supernatural.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus we find the existence of magic in the earliest period
of human thought generally assumed by anthropologists,
but some writers deny that man always has believed in
supernatural beings. He first, they tell us, had a vague
notion that by propitiating or by coercing nature he might
secure for himself happiness; and that if anything external
was to have power over the workings of the natural structure,
it must be man, for both gods and God were yet unknown.
Only gradually, they hold, through his belief in
tree-spirits, through his devotion to plants or fetishes made
sacred by their supposed efficacy in serving human wishes,
perhaps, too, through his attitude toward human beings
whose reputation for skill in magic finally led to deification,
did man come to a belief in more or less divine beings and
turn to them for the power and the happiness which in his
savage and untutored impotency he had been unable to win
by his own efforts.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Then only would the performance of
magic by the aid of supernatural beings commence.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another misleading idea which we should avoid.
Fairy tales and romances picture magicians to us as few
in number, adepts in a secret art. Instinctively, moreover,
looking as we do upon magic as a mere delusion, we are
prone to regard it as the creation of the popular imagination,
and to believe that what magicians there were outside
of the ordinary man’s imagination were a few imposters
who took advantage of his fancies, or a few self-deceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>dreamers whose minds such fancies had led astray. This
is a superficial view. It does not explain how the ordinary
man came to imagine the existence of magic. Magicians
in the true sense were no mere imaginary order existent only
in the minds of men, nor a profession of dreamers and imposters.
Magic was not the outright invention of imagination;
it was primitive man’s philosophy, it was his attitude toward
nature. It was originally not the exercise of supposed
innate, marvelous powers by a favored few nor a group of
secret doctrines or practices known to but a few; it was a
body of ideas held by men universally and which, during
their savage state at least, they were forever trying to put
into practice. Everybody was a magician.</p>

<p class='c010'>To understand magic, then, we should consider this attitude
of primitive man—I use the word primitive in no narrow
sense—and should try to picture to ourselves what his
attitude would be. It is a safe assumption that he would
interpret the world about him according to his own sensations,
feelings and motives. Whether he looked upon nature
at large or in detail, he would in all probability regard
it not as an inexorable machine run in accordance with
universal and immutable laws, but as a being or world of
beings much like himself—fickle, changing, capable of being
influenced by inducements or deterred by threats, beneficent
or hostile according as satisfied or offended by treatment
received. To make life go as he wished, he must
be able to please and propitiate or to coerce these forces
outside himself.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> In this endeavor his faculty of association
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>probably led him to conclude that things resembling
each other or having any seeming connection must be related
by strong bonds of sympathy and have power over
each other. Since he had already attributed human characteristics
to matter, he naturally now observed no distinction
between the animate and the inanimate, the material
and the spiritual. A wooden image might be used to affect
the fate of a human being, or the utterance of alluring and
terrifying sounds to produce change in unfeeling and unresponsive
matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, as man observed the world about him, he
would note many a phenomenon in nature which he could
explain only by assuming strange and subtle influences.
There was, for instance, the magnet, so different from
other stones; the hot spring, so different from other waters;
the action of electricity—still a mystery. Such things, too,
as a calf with five legs, a dream, a sneeze, appealed to him
as peculiar and striking, and perplexed him. He thought
that they must have some important significance. His
attempt to explain all such phenomena generally led him
into magic.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Man often had to decide between two or more courses of
action, apparently equally pleasing and advantageous or
displeasing and disadvantageous. Should he turn to the
right or to the left; should he begin his journey to-day or
to-morrow? The thought probably came to him that one
of these directions, one of these days, would in the end
prove more advantageous than the other, though at present
he could see no difference between them. One must be
lucky, the other unlucky. This belief in lucky times, places
and actions was magic. For such times, places and actions
were magical as truly as the cloak that is unlike other cloaks
or the change that differs from other changes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Akin to man’s desire to discover what course of action
would bring him good luck was the longing he doubtless
had to know the future; a knowledge which would be as
interesting as those tales of his ancestor’s doings in which
he delighted, and of more practical use. As he had no difficulty
in granting to matter spiritual qualities or in subjecting
to trivial material influences mind and soul without
power of resistance, so now he sought in the present sure
signs of his own future. Such indications seemed to him to
be found not only in dreams, which indeed had some connection
with his personality, but also in such things as the
flight of birds or the movements of the stars. He often did
more than assign magic powers to the heavenly bodies;
often he worshiped them as gods. His effort thus to learn
the future from inadequate and irrelevant present phenomena
was divination or magic.</p>

<p class='c010'>These notions of primitive man do not exhaust the field
of magic. As he became educated, he would extend the
attribution of magic properties to such things as numbers
and written characters or formulæ. His original ideas
might be elaborated or refined. But already he accepted the
principles upon which a belief in magic founds itself. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>principles were evidently common property. Of course
some men would come to surpass others in their knowledge
of the supposed bonds of sympathy between different things,
or of lucky objects, seasons and methods, of ways to coax
and control natural forces, of the meaning of portents and
of means to predict the future. In the progress of time the
finer mysteries of the art might become the monopoly of a
priesthood. But everybody believed in magic; everybody
understood something about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>To attempt to define magic further than has been done
in our description of the notions of primitive man is like
trying to embrace a phantom. Magic rested upon man’s
conjecture of the characteristics and processes of nature,
not on a knowledge of nature correctly deduced from observation
and experiment. As one would expect, there
went with these mistaken notions a fantasticalness both in
reasoning and in practical procedure. The follower of
magic is apt to be on the watch not for facts or laws, but
for hidden mysteries; he is fond of ceremonial and symbols;
he enjoins upon himself and his fellows the necessity of
secrecy in their operations and mysticism in their writings.
Again, magic is, as has been said, præternatural; its outcome
is to be marvelous. It assumes the existence of wonderful
properties in various objects and of wonderful bonds
of sympathy between different things. Finally, we should
remember that man always is a factor in magic. His knowledge,
skill or power is always essential to the performance
of a feat of magic. Even when demons do the deed, they
must be invoked. A miracle may be contrary to natural
law but it is not magic, for man is not the cause of it.
Even if wrought in answer to his prayer, the miracle is not
magic, for the gods answer only if they choose. But the
magic formula compels the desired marvel; by it man coerces
nature or even deity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Such are some of the chief characteristics of magic. Yet
with these granted, it remains, like superstition or religion,
a vague term at best. The reader may disagree with me
as to exactly what beliefs and practices should be included
under it, and it is indeed a nice question just where magic
begins and ends. Much of alchemy, for example, was nothing
but chemistry of a rude sort, and perhaps even its theories
that metals may be transmuted and life greatly prolonged
will some day prove to have had much truth in
them. On the other hand, alchemy was based to a considerable
extent on a belief that plants, animals and minerals
have properties and powers which they cannot have: and if
we ever do succeed in making gold or putting off old age,
it is quite certain that such a consummation will never be
accomplished by the fantastic methods which alchemists
usually employed. Similarly we shall see that the practice
of allegorical interpretation of past writings and the Pythagorean
doctrine of numbers, which perhaps at first thought
one would not regard as magic at all, nevertheless bear at
least some resemblance to it. But after all our thesis is not
to establish a certain definition for the word “magic,” or
to prove that such and such ideas and acts are magical.
A name signifies little, and the word magic has had too
many different meanings in different periods and for different
men to allow any one to assert with confidence that he
has found an absolutely correct definition. I employ the
word simply because it seems the most convenient, most intelligible
and most justifiable term for denoting a number
of beliefs which I believe are all intimately related and
which are the marks of a certain attitude towards the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for the definition of magic and for the nature
of its origin. But the discussion of these two points does
not fully explain the meaning of the beliefs which were
illustrated in our first chapter. We have yet to bring out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the full significance of the presence of such notions in the
minds of mediæval thinkers and scientists.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was stated above that the outcome of magic is præternatural,
marvelous; but this statement, while in one sense
perfectly true, requires some qualification. Perhaps to inexperienced
primitive man the results which he wished to
accomplish or the crude theories on which he based his
operations seemed nothing remarkable. Perhaps incantation
seemed to him the natural way to bring rain, and sorcery
the sole cause of disease. But as time went on and
observation taught men, it must have been impressed upon
their minds that either the events they sought to produce, or
the methods by which they sought to produce them, were a
little out of the ordinary, although of the possibility of the
events and of the validity of the methods they still remained
convinced. If we wish to sum up the whole history of
magic in a sentence, we may say that men first regarded
magic as natural, then as marvelous, then as impossible and
absurd. Evidently then magic is subjective, as anything
false must be. To-day in the thought of educated and sensible
people it is limited in actual significance to stage illusions;
once it was a universal attitude towards the universe.
As one false hypothesis after another was superseded by
true notions, the content of magic narrowed in men’s
minds until at last it became an acknowledged deception.
Meanwhile its mistaken premises and strange proceedings
first mingled with and then vanished into science and scientific
methods.</p>

<p class='c010'>This, then, is the significance of the beliefs of which we
were speaking in the first chapter. They are phenomena in
that union—or struggle—of magic and science which
marked the decay of the former and the development of the
latter. As such, they warn us not to picture a magician to
ourselves as armed with a wand, clad in solemn robes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and attended by a black cat. They warn us, on the other
hand, not to regard the learned students of nature, mathematics
and medicine in ages past as modern scientists in
mind and spirit, who were merely handicapped by such obstacles
as crude instruments and want of data. We perceive
the anachronism involved in explaining away as mere
passing fancies, personal eccentricities or anomalous beliefs
the superstitious or bizarre notions of those to whom tradition
has accorded great fame. We are warned to consider
carefully whether such notions were not ingrained in
the very being of those men and characteristic of their whole
mental attitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>Science and magic are very unlike, but even the distinction
between East and West varies according to where
the speaker takes his stand. We have come to regard
science as abstract truth, scientific investigation as necessarily
correct and sensible; we forget that science has a
past. In their actual history science and magic were not
unassociated. Scientists might accept magical doctrines
and magic might endeavor to classify its fancies and to
account for them by natural causes. Roger Bacon could
regard the attainment of magical results as the great end of
experimental science. Francis Bacon could place magic in
the same category with metaphysics and physics.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is with this mingling of magic and science—or more
broadly of magic with learning in general—in the history
of our Western world that this essay has to do. It is a
theme of no narrow interest. Such ideas as have been
cited, not only held by the most learned men of the times
but incorporated in their scientific and philosophical systems—in
so far as they had any—deserve consideration in the
history of science and philosophy as well as in that of
magic, or in an investigation of the mental make-up of
the men of the past.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>While, however, the place of magic in the intellectual
history of Europe is our general subject, the present essay
is far from being an attempt at a complete treatment of
it. The aim is rather to illustrate that theme by a survey
of learning during the period of the Roman Empire, when
the divers threads of the thought and knowledge of the
ancient world were to some extent united. The prominence
of magic in mediæval science is perhaps better known and
more generally admitted. Accordingly this essay will take
for granted, except in so far as it has been illustrated in
our first chapter, the presence of magic in mediæval learning,
and will try to show that magical doctrines, credulity,
mysticism, and love of the marvelous were not traits peculiar
to mediæval thought, but that in this respect (as in
others) there was close resemblance, probably strict continuity
between the Roman world and later times. It was
largely in order to bring out this resemblance, continuity
and influence that the beliefs of various writers in the
Middle Ages and early modern times were given in the
first chapter. Let the reader compare them with those
notions of men in the Roman Empire which will presently
be set forth. If we are justified in thus regarding
the Roman world as summarizing ancient science and
helping to explain mediæval thought, we evidently, in taking
our stand in that period secure a broad prospect and
ought to obtain a fair idea of the place of magic in the
intellectual history of Europe. In defining the field which
we are to cover, it should be further said that Christian
thought will not come into our discussion, since it did
not greatly influence science and other secular learning until
the close of the Roman Empire. Lastly, it should be clearly
understood that we are here concerned with magic only as
connected with science and with learning—only as accepted
by educated men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Pliny’s Natural History</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We should have to search long before finding a better
starting-point for the consideration of the union of magic
with the science of the Roman Empire and of the way in
which that union influenced the Middle Ages than Pliny’s
<cite>Natural History</cite>. Its encyclopedic character affords a
bird’s-eye view of our entire subject. Its varied contents
suggest practically all the themes of our discussion in succeeding
chapters. Chronologically considered, it is satisfactory
as an introduction, since it appeared in the early
part of the Empire (77 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>).</p>

<p class='c010'>I. <em>The character of the work.</em>—Pliny’s treatise is far
more than what we understand by a “Natural History.”
It is an attempt to cover the whole field of science; <i><span lang="la">rerum
natura</span></i> is its subject.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a> This, as Pliny says, is a task which
no single Greek or Roman has before attempted. He tells
us that he treats of some 20,000 topics gleaned from the
perusal of about 2,000 volumes, with the addition of many
facts not contained in previous works and only recently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>brought to light.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a> At first thought, then, the <cite>Natural History</cite>,
vast in its scope and constituting a summary of the
views of previous authorities, would seem the best single
example of the science of the classical world. The fact
that it touches upon many of the varieties and illustrates
most of the characteristics of magic makes it the more fitting
a starting-point for us. Indeed, Pliny makes frequent
mention of the Magi, and in the opening chapters of his
thirtieth book gives the most important extant discussion of
magic by an ancient writer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true, however, that Pliny does not seem to have
been a man of much scientific training and experience. He
said himself that his days were taken up with the performance
of public duties, and that consequently his scientific
labors were largely carried on in the evening hours.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Probably
we should regard his book as little more than a compilation,
and perhaps no very judicious compilation at that,
in view of his maxim that there is no book so bad but that
some good may be got from it.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Perhaps we may not unjustly
picture him to ourselves as collecting his material in
a rather haphazard fashion; as not always aware of the
latest theories or discoveries; as occasionally citing a fantastic
writer instead of a more sober one; or as quoting
incorrectly statements which his limited scientific knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>prevented him from comprehending. Perhaps, too, he derived
some of his data directly from popular report and
superstition. Certainly to us to-day his work seems a disorderly
and indiscriminate conglomeration of fact and
legend on all sorts of subjects—disorderly, in that its
author does not seem to have made any effort to sift his
material, to compare and arrange his facts, even in his own
mind; indiscriminate, in that Pliny seems to lack any standard
of judgment between the true and the false, and to
deem almost nothing too improbable, silly or indelicate to
be mentioned. Ought we to consider such a work as truly
representative of the beliefs of preceding centuries, or as
an example of the best educated thought and science of
its author’s own age? This is a question which we must
consider.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet as we read Pliny’s pages we feel that he possessed
elements of greatness. If he was equipped with little scientific
training or experience, we should remember that little
training or experience was necessary to deal with the science
of those days. At least he sacrificed his life in an effort to
investigate natural phenomena. Moreover, his faults were
probably to a great extent common to his age. The tendency
to regard anything written as of at least some value
did not begin with him. Material had often before been
collected in a haphazard manner. Lewes, in his book on
the science of Aristotle, has described with truth even the
famous <cite>History of Animals</cite> as unclassified in arrangement
and careless in the selection of material.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Many of Pliny’s
marvelous assertions and absurd remedies purport to be from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the works of men of note, although possibly he was sometimes
deceived by spurious writings. He frequently gives us
to understand that he himself intends to maintain a cautious
and critical frame of mind, and he makes great pretensions
to immunity from that credulousness of human nature over
which he will occasionally smile or philosophize.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> When
we take up Aristotle’s <cite>History of Animals</cite> and Seneca’s
<cite>Natural Questions</cite>, it will become evident that Pliny’s
“science” was not very different in quality from that of
the Greeks or from that of his own age. If he seldom
gives us a clear-cut or complete exposition of a subject, it
is probably because there was seldom one to be found. If
he seems in a chronic state of mental confusion and incoherency,
it is because his task staggered him. His work was
by its nature so far impersonal that we can attribute its
defects only in part to his personality.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, then, we probably shall not be greatly misled
if we regard the <cite>Historia Naturalis</cite> as a sort of epitome
of what men had believed about nature in the past or did
believe in Pliny’s own day. The author may not have portrayed
past and present thought at their best but he portrayed
them, and that in detail. “The greatest gull of antiquity”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
was the Boswell of ancient science.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Pliny makes almost as good a representative of mediæval
science as of that of the Roman world, and thus well illustrates
the influence which the one had upon the other. Indeed
not only is the <cite>Natural History</cite> just the sort of work
that delighted the Middle Ages, but Pliny seems to have
exerted a considerable direct influence on writers down
through the sixteenth century. Isidore of Seville practically
copied his unfavorable comments on the magi and his
discussion of the powers of stones.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Bede seems to have
owed a good deal to him. Alcuin openly praised that
“most devoted investigator of nature.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Roger Bacon
quoted him; the <cite>Natural History</cite> was a mine whence
Agrippa dug much of the material for his <cite>Occult Philosophy</cite>
and to which Porta seems equally indebted in his <cite>Natural
Magic</cite>.</p>

<p class='c010'>II. <em>Pliny’s discussion of magic.</em>—Before illustrating
Pliny’s combination of magical lore with true and sane
statements about nature, we should consider his discussion
of what he was pleased to call magic; for just as he prided
himself upon his freedom from excessive credulity in the
abstract, so in regard to magic in particular he seems to
have flattered himself that his position was quite different
from what it actually was.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Pliny did have, however, a fairly clear idea of the extensive
scope of magic as well as of its great age and currency.
Not only did he declare that of all known arts it had exerted
the greatest influence in every land and in almost every age,
but “no one,” he said, “should wonder that its authority
has been very great, since it alone has embraced and combined
into one the three other subjects which appeal most
powerfully to man’s mind.”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> For magic had invaded the
domain of religion and had also made astrology a part of
itself,<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> while “no one doubts that it originally sprang from
medicine and crept in under the show of promoting health
as a loftier and more holy medicine.”<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Indeed, he thinks
that the development of magic and of medicine have been
parallel<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> and that the latter is now in imminent danger of
being overwhelmed by the follies of magic which have made
men doubt whether plants possess any medicinal properties
at all.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Pliny, moreover, sees the connection of magic with
the lore of the magi of Persia. Indeed, “magus” is his
only word for a magician. But this does not lead him to
admit what some persons—the philosopher Eudoxus, for
instance—have asserted, that magic is the most splendid
and useful branch of philosophy.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a> For Pliny, magic is
always something reprehensible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The magi are either fools or imposters. They are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><i><span lang="la">genus vanissimum</span></i>.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a> They believe such absurdities as that
herbs can dry up swamps and rivers, open all barriers,
turn hostile battle-lines in flight, and insure their possessor,
wherever he may be, abundant provision for every need.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
They make statements which Pliny thinks must have been
dictated by a feeling of contempt and derision for the
human race. They affirm that gems carved with the names
of sun and moon and attached to the neck by hairs of the
cynocephalus and feathers of the swallow will neutralize the
effect of potions, win audience with kings, and, with the
aid of some additional ceremony, ward off hail and locusts.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
They have the impudence to assert that the stone “heliotropium,”
combined with the plant of the same name and
with due incantations, renders its bearer invisible.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a> “Vanitas”
is Pliny’s stock-word for their statements. Nero
proved how hollow are their pretenses by the fact that, although
he was most eagerly devoted to the pursuit of magic
arts and had every opportunity to acquire skill in them, he
was unable to effect any marvels through their agency and
abandoned the study of them.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Moreover, magi or magicians deal with the inhuman, the
obscene and the abominable. Osthanes, and even the philosopher
Democritus, are led by their devotion to magic into
propounding such remedies as drinking human blood or
utilizing in magic compounds or ceremonies portions of the
corpses of men violently slain.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Magic is a malicious and
criminal art. Its devotees attempt the transfer of disease
from one person to another or the exercise of baleful sorcery.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
“It cannot be sufficiently estimated how great a
debt is due the Romans who did away with those monstrous
rites in which to slay a man was most pious; nay more, to
eat men most wholesome.”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a> In fine, we may rest persuaded
that magic is “execrable, ineffectual and inane.”
Yet it possesses some shadow of truth, but is of avail
through “veneficas artes&#160;... non magicas,”<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> whatever
that distinction may be.</p>

<p class='c010'>III. <em>Illustrations of Pliny’s fundamental belief in magic.</em>—Pliny,
we have seen, made a bold pretense of utter disbelief
in magic, and also censured the art on grounds of decency,
morality and humanity. Yet despite this wholesale condemnation,
in some places in his work it is difficult to tell
where his quotations from magicians cease and where statements
which he accepts recommence. Sometimes he explicitly
quoted theories or facts from the writings of the
“magi” without censure and without any expression of
disbelief. If it is contended that he none the less regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>them as false and worthless, we may fairly ask, why then
did he give them such a prominent place in his encyclopedia?
Surely we must conclude either that he really had
a liking for them himself and more than half believed them,
or that previous works on nature were so full of such material
and his own age so interested in such data that he could
not but include much of this lore. Probably both alternatives
are true. Finally, many things which Pliny states
without any reference to the magi seem as false and absurd
as the far-fetched assertions which he attributes to them
and for which he shows so much scorn. Indeed, it hardly
seems paradoxical to say that he hated the magi but liked
their doctrines.</p>

<p class='c010'>What clearer example of magic could one ask than the
conclusion that the odor of the burning horn of a stag has
the power of dispelling serpents, because enmity exists between
stags and snakes, and the former track the latter to
their holes and extract the snakes thence, despite all resistance,
by the power of their breath? Or that on this same
account the sovereign remedy for snake-bite comes “ex
coagulo hinnulei matris in utero occisi?” Or that, since
the stag is not subject to fever, the eating of its flesh will
prevent that disease, especially if the animal has died of a
single wound? What more magical than to fancy that the
longest tooth of a fish could have any efficacy in the cure
of fever? Or that excluding the person who had tied it on
from the sight of the patient for five days would complete
a perfect charm? Or that wearing as an amulet the carcass
of a frog, minus the claws and wrapped in a piece of russet-colored
cloth, would be of any aid against disease?<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Yet
the <cite>Natural History</cite> is full of such things.</p>

<p class='c010'>To plants, for example, Pliny assigns powers no less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>marvelous than those which he has attributed to animals.
There is one plant which, held in the hand, has a beneficial
effect upon the groin;<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> another overcomes the asp with torpor,
and hence, beaten up with oil, is a remedy for the sting
of that snake.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Fern, he says, if mowed down with the edge
of a reed or uprooted by a ploughshare on which a reed has
been placed, will not spring up again.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Moreover, in his
twenty-fourth book, immediately after having announced
that he has sufficiently discussed for the present the marvelous
properties attributed to herbs by the magi,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> he proceeds
to mention the following remedies. One is a quick cure
for headache, and consists in gathering a plant growing on
the head of a statue and attaching it to your neck with a
red string. Another is a cure for tertian fever, and consists
in plucking a certain herb before sunrise on the banks
of a stream and in fastening it to the patient’s left arm
without his knowledge. A third recipe instructs us that
plants which have taken root in a sieve that has been thrown
into a hedge-row “decerptae adalligataeque gravidis partus
adcelerant.” A fourth would have herbs growing on dunghills
a cure for quinzy, and a fifth assures us that sprains
may be speedily cured by the application of a plant “iuxta
quam canes urinam fundunt,” torn up by the roots and not
allowed to touch iron.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Coming to minerals we find Pliny rather more reticent
in regard to strange qualities. His account of gems is written
mainly from the jeweler’s point of view. When marvelous
powers are mentioned, the magi are usually made responsible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and such powers are frequently rejected as absurd.
Pliny, however, grants some magic properties in
certain stones. Molochitis, by some medicinal power which
it possesses, guards infants against dangers;<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a> and eumecas,
placed beneath the head at night, causes oracular visions.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
To water Pliny allows powers which we must regard as
magical, for according to him certain rivers pass under the
sea because of their hatred of it.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In man, moreover, as well as in other creatures upon
earth, there is magic power. Pliny mentions men whose
eyes are able to exert strong fascination,<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a> others who fill
serpents with terror and can cure snake-bite by merely
touching the wound, and others who by their presence addle
eggs in the vicinity.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Pliny takes up the power of words
and incantations in connection with man. Whether they
have potency beyond what we expect ordinary speech to
possess is a great and unanswered question. Our ancestors,
Pliny says, always believed so, and in every-day life we
often unconsciously accept such a view ourselves. If, for
instance, we believe that the Vestal virgins can, by an imprecation,
stop runaway slaves who are still within the city
limits, we must accept the whole theory of the power of
words. But, taken as individuals, the wisest men lack faith
in the doctrine.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Pliny, then, believed in the possession of magic properties
by well-nigh all varieties of terrestrial substances, nay
even by colors and numbers, and in strange relations of
occult sympathy, love and hatred between different things
in the realm of nature. His acceptance of ceremony as efficacious
has also been brought out to some extent. We have
seen him attributing importance to death from a single
wound, to suspension by a single hair, to fastening an amulet
without the patient’s knowledge, or to the absence for a
time from the patient’s sight of the person who attached it.
We will consider one or two more such instances among
the many which exist in his pages.</p>

<p class='c010'>He who gathers the iris should be in a state of chastity.
Three months beforehand let him soak the ground around
the plant with hydromel—as a sort of atonement to appease
the earth. When he comes to pluck it, he should first trace
three circles about it with the point of a sword, and, the
moment he plucks it, raise it aloft towards the heavens.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
In another passage, in connection with the application of a
mixture to an inflammatory tumor, Pliny says that persons
of experience regard it as very important that the poultice
be applied by a naked virgin and that both she and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>patient be fasting. Touching the sufferer with the back of
her hand, she is to say, “Apollo forbids a disease to increase
which a naked virgin restrains.” Then, withdrawing her
hand, she is to repeat the same words thrice and to join
with the patient in spitting on the ground each time.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Pliny occasionally prefaces his marvelous remedies by
some such expression as “it is said.” This circumstance
is scarcely to be taken as a sign of mental reservation, however,
as the following absurd statement, which he makes
upon his own authority and declares is easily tested by experiment,
will indicate. “If a person repents of a blow
given to another, either by hand or with a missile, let him
spit at once into the palm of the hand which inflicted the
blow, and all resentment in the person struck will instantly
vanish.” This is often proved, according to Pliny, in the
case of beasts of burden, which can be induced to increase
their speed by this method after the use of the whip has
failed.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>One can, perhaps, make some distinction between the
strange influences which Pliny credited and the statements
of the magi which he rejected. I believe that he did not
go to the length of affirming that plants or parts of animals
could cause panics, procure provisions, win you royal favor,
gain for you vengeance on your enemies, or make you invisible.
But he was inconsistent enough. After asserting
that a single fish but a few inches long could immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>arrest the progress of the largest vessel by attaching itself
to the keel of the ship,<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a> was it for him to declare false the
notion that a stone can calm winds or ward off hail and
swarms of locusts? He characterized as “idle talk” the assertion
of the magi that the stone “gorgonia” counteracted
fascination,<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a> but he had already written: “Id quoque convenit,
quo nihil equidem libentius crediderim, tactis omnino
menstruo postibus inritas fieri magorum artes, generis vanissimi,
ut aestimare licet.”<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Apparently, then, the only
charge which he could bring against magicians without reflecting
upon himself was that of malicious and criminal
practices. His beliefs were much like theirs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed, the varieties of magic in the <cite>Natural History</cite>
have not yet been exhausted. For one thing, we must consider
Pliny’s position in regard to magic properties of the
stars as well as of terrestrial matter. He believed in astrology,
at least to some extent, although one might not think
it if one read only the passage in which he speaks of the
debt of gratitude mankind owe to the great geniuses who
have freed them from superstitious fear of eclipses.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> He
could, nevertheless, in naming some prominent personage
in each of the primary arts and sciences, mention Berosus,
to whom a public statue has been erected by the Athenians
in honor of his skill in prognostication, in connection with
astrology.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Pliny himself holds that the universe is a divinity, “holy
eternal, vast, all in all—nay, in truth is itself all,” a proposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>rather favorable to astrological theory.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> The sun is
the mind and soul of the whole world and the chief governor
of nature.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a> The planets affect each other. A cold
star renders another approaching it pale; a hot star causes
its neighbor to redden; a windy planet gives those near it
a lowering aspect.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Saturn is cold and rigid; Mars a flaming
fire; Jupiter, located between them, is temperate and
salubrious.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a> When the planets reach a certain point in their
orbits, they are deflected from their regular course by the
rays of the sun.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Besides effects upon each other the planets exert especial
influence upon the earth. “Potentia autem ad terram magnopere
eorum pertinens.”<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> They govern, each according
to its nature, the weather on our globe.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a> The planets also
have great influence upon diseases and on animal and plant
life in general, although Pliny does not dwell upon this
point at any length.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> The moon, a feminine and nocturnal
star, stirs up humors on earth and is powerful in producing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>putrefaction and corruption in matter.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a> By the nature of
Venus every thing on earth is generated.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>To what extent the planets rule man’s life Pliny does not
specify—an instance of prudent reticence on his part, if he
really consciously avoided the question. He disclaims any
belief in the vulgar notion that a star, varying in brightness
according to our wealth, is assigned to each of us, and that
the eternal stars rise and fade at the birth or death of insignificant
mortals. “Non tanta caelo societas nobiscum est
ut nostro fato mortalis sit ibi quoque siderum fulgor.”<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
But thus to deny that the stars are ruled by man’s destiny
or doings is far from refusing to believe that men’s lives
are ordered by the stars. Pliny, as we have seen, holds that
Venus has a considerable influence over the process of birth
in all animals. Also he certainly accepts the portentous
character of various particular celestial phenomena. “From
the stars celestial fire is vomited forth bearing omens of
the future.”<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> He gives instances from Roman history of
comets which signalled disaster, expounds the theory that
their significance is to be determined from the direction in
which they move and the heavenly body whose powers they
receive, and states that the particular phase of life to which
they apply may be deduced from the shape which they
assume or from their position in relation to the signs of the
zodiac.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Pliny’s belief in portents seems to have been general and
not limited to celestial phenomena. In a passage on earthquakes
he declares, “Never has the city of Rome shaken
but that this was a forewarning of some future event.”<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Pliny is less certain in regard to the superstitious observances
so common then, to secure good luck or ward off
evil fortune. In chapter five of his twenty-eighth book he
gives quite a list of practices, such as selecting persons with
lucky names to lead the victims at public lustrations, saluting
those who sneeze, placing saliva behind the ear to escape
mental anxiety, removing rings while eating, averting the
ill-omen of mentioning fire at meal-time by pouring water
beneath the table, and other superstitious table etiquette. He
cites beliefs of the same nature, as that odd numbers are for
every purpose the more efficacious, that medicines do no
good if placed on a table before being administered, that
baldness and headaches may be prevented by cutting the
hair on the seventeenth and twenty-ninth days of the moon,
and that women who walk along country roads twirling
distaffs, or even having these uncovered, bring very bad
luck, especially to the crops. He seems to have inclined to
the belief that there was a modicum of truth, at any rate,
in these notions and customs—and certainly we have already
seen him affirming the validity of analogous practices—but
he finally decides that amid the great variety of opinion existing
in the matter he will not be dogmatic and that each
person may think as he deems best. His attitude is much
the same in regard to divination from thunder and lightning.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>With all the foolish notions which he imbibed from antiquity
or into which his mind, over-hospitable to the fantastic
and marvelous, led him, Pliny had one good scientific
trait. He might believe in magic but he had no liking for
the esoteric. His mind might be confused but it was not
mystical. He had no desire to hide the “secrets” of
science and philosophy from the public gaze, to wrap them
up in obscure and allegorical verbiage lest the unworthy
comprehend them. On the contrary, he sharply remarked
apropos the lack of information about the medicinal properties
of plants, that there was a most shameful reason for
this scarcity, namely, that even those who knew were unwilling
to give forth their knowledge, “as if that would
be lost to themselves which they passed on to others.”<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Such, then, is the <cite>Natural History</cite>. Pliny gives evidence
that many of the most intelligent men were coming to
doubt a large part of the superstitious beliefs and observances
once universally prevalent, and he himself makes a
brave effort to assume a critical and judicious attitude.
Yet his work contains a great deal of magic and reveals,
what this essay in its entirety will make further evident, the
error of such a statement as the following from Dr. White’s
<cite>Warfare of Science and Theology</cite>:</p>

<p class='c012'>Under the old Empire a real science was coming in and
thought progressing. Both the theory and practice of magic
were more and more held up to ridicule. Even as early a
writer as Ennius ridiculed the idea that magicians, who were
generally poor and hungry themselves, could bestow wealth on
others; Pliny, in his <cite>Natural Philosophy</cite>, showed at great length
their absurdities and cheatery; others followed in the same line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of thought, and the whole theory, except among the very lowest
classes, seemed dying out.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Some Antecedents of the Belief in Magic in the Roman Empire</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Writers who have discussed the intellectual life under
the Roman Empire generally agree that it was not marked
by originality and creative power, and owed a perhaps unusually
large debt to the past. The cosmopolitan character
of the Empire, the mingling at that time of the science,
theology, philosophy and superstition of different nations,
religions and races, deserve equal emphasis. The lore of
the magi of Persia, the occult science of Egypt, perhaps
even the doctrines of the gymnosophists of India, may be
regarded, together with that belief in divination which
played such a rôle in classical religion and government and
with other superstitious notions of Greeks and Italians, as
contributory to the prominence of magic in the Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>To discuss with any attempt at completeness the influence
of the past upon the belief in magic in the Empire lies,
however, outside the province of this essay. Pliny has
shown us something of the union of magic with science in
the literature before his day. Philo of Alexandria, Apuleius
and the fame of Hermes Trismegistus may give us
some notion of the influence of the East. In other writers
of the period of which we treat one may discern further
traces of the thought and learning of the past. In general
such evidence must suffice. We shall, however, presently
take occasion to support our contention that Pliny gives one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>a fairly good idea of science before his day, by a few citations
from two writers of repute, one a Greek and one a
Roman, of the period before the Empire. Moreover, the
great historical importance of Greek philosophy and the fact
that, besides playing a prominent part in Roman culture, it
exercised a powerful direct influence on Christian Europe
long after the fall of Rome, seem to justify some treatment
of its doctrines. Especially may we mention Plato and Aristotle,
who exerted great influence not only during classical
times, but also the one in the Middle Ages, the other in the
period following the decline of Scholasticism.</p>

<p class='c010'>We naturally incline to regard this earlier period of
more or less distinctively Greek thought and learning as a
golden age, comparatively speaking, characterized by sane
thinking if not also by careful investigation of nature, and
free from superstition, credulity and mysticism. The general
opinion seems to be that magic entered science and
learning and was accepted by men of intellectual prominence
only when mental decay had set in and when Oriental
influence had become a powerful force.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet something might be said for the opposite view that
this earlier age combined magic with its science and philosophy
as much, if not more, than the later time. We know
that Greek philosophy had its beginnings in mythology; and
if the representatives of its maturity accepted the Greek religion
with its auspices drawn from sacrifices, its oracles
and the like, we may with reason ask, is it probable that
they would hesitate to give similar doctrines a place in their
scientific and philosophical systems? Pliny, for his part,
evidently regarded himself as less credulous and as less inclined
to magic than the ancient Greeks, although it is true
that he attributed their belief to Oriental influence. He declared
that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato
had learned the magic art abroad and had taught it on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>return.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Beside the name of Hippocrates in the field of
medicine he set that of Democritus in the domain of magic.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
Elsewhere he said that Pythagoras and Democritus, having
embraced the doctrine of the magi, first expounded the
properties of magic plants in the Western world.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a> In
Cicero’s <cite>De Divinatione</cite>, Epicurus is alone of the Greek
philosophers declared free from trust in divination, and
Panætius is said to have been the only Stoic to reject
astrology.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Fortunately we are not here concerned to measure either
relatively or absolutely with any attempt at exactness the
amount of magic in the learning of the closing centuries of
Greek national life, but only to investigate whether in the
philosophy of the Greeks there were not theories at least
liable to encourage a later age to belief in magic. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>was, for instance, the view of the Stoics that the universe
is a single living whole—a theory well fitted to form the
starting-point for a belief in sympathetic magic. Also their
doctrine that events are all arranged in a fatal causal series
was favorable to divination. Quintus Cicero, represented
as upholding the truth of that art, cites the Stoics as authority,
and we may safely assume that Seneca drew his view
of divination largely from the same source.</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctrine of Pythagoras also deserves mention, for it
has played a great rôle in history. He is said to have held
that the whole world is, and that the life of man ought to
be, harmoniously ordered in accordance with mathematical
principles; nay more, that such principles are living things
and that numbers are the essence of the universe. The logical
conclusion is that by skilful use of mere numbers
man can move heaven and earth. As the poet, eulogizing
Michael Scot, put it; the “mathematici” by their art affect
numbers, by numbers affect the procession of the stars, and
by the stars move the universe. The employment of characters
constructed of numbers or of geometrical figures, the
use of numerical formulæ as remedies or of compounds of
three portions of three kinds of drugs applied during three
successive days, is raised from the plane of superstition to
the level of science. It is not unreasonable to suppose that
the heavenly bodies with their apparently unchanging regularity
of movement are the governors of our existence.
Plato, who adopted the Pythagorean doctrines at least to a
considerable extent, declared that the loftiest function of the
sense of sight was to survey the heavens, an occupation by
which we gain philosophy.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a> Like the Pythagoreans also,
he associated the four elements with regular solids. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>cube represented earth; the octohedron was water; the tetrahedron,
fire; and the icosahedron, air.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a> The remaining
regular solid, the dodecahedron, was held to represent the
universe as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards magic, as he understood it, Plato’s attitude
seems to have been sceptical, though perhaps not confidently
so. He maintained that persons acquainted with medicine
and prophets or diviners were the only ones who could
know the nature of poisons which worked naturally, and of
such things as incantations, magic knots and waxen images;
and that since other men had no certain knowledge of such
things, they ought not to fear but to despise them. He admitted,
however, that there was no use in trying to convince
most men of this and that legislation against sorcery was
necessary.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a> He himself occasionally mentioned charms or
soothsaying in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever Plato’s opinion of vulgar magic, his view of
nature was much like that of primitive man. He humanized
material objects and materialized spiritual characteristics.
For instance, he asserted that the gods placed the
lungs about the heart “as a soft spring that, when passion
was rife within, the heart, beating against a yielding body,
might be cooled and suffer less, and might thus become
more ready to join with passion in the service of reason.”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
He affirmed that the liver was designed for divination, and
was a sort of mirror on which the thoughts of the intellect
fell and in which the images of the soul were reflected, but
that its predictions ceased to be clear after death.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Plato
spoke of the existence of harmonious love between the elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>as the source of health and plenty for vegetation,
beasts and men. Their “wanton love” he made the cause
of pestilence and disease. To understand both varieties of
love “in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies
and the seasons of the year is,” he tells us, “termed astronomy.”<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a>
This suggests that he believed in astrology—in
the potent influence of the stars over all changes in earthly
matter. He called the stars “divine and eternal animals,
ever abiding.”<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a> The “lower gods,” of whom many at
least are identical with the heavenly bodies, form men who,
if they live well, return after death each to a happy existence
in his proper star.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a> The implication is, though Plato
does not say so distinctly, that the stars influence human life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aristotle’s doctrine was similar. Windelband has well
expressed his view:</p>

<p class='c012'>The stars themselves were&#160;... for Aristotle beings of superhuman
intelligence, incorporate deities. They appeared to him
as the purer forms, those more like the deity, and from them a
purposive rational influence upon the lower life of the earth
seemed to proceed—a thought which became the root of mediæval
astrology.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, “his theory of the subordinate gods of the
spheres of the planets&#160;... provided for a later demonology.”<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
And a belief in demons fosters a belief in magic.
For such subordinate gods—on the one hand movers of
nature’s forces, and on the other hand subject to passions
like man and open to influence through symbols and conjurations—are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>evidently most suitable agents for the worker
of magic to employ. We must also mention Aristotle’s
attribution of “souls” to plants and animals, a theory
which would readily lend itself to an assumption of magic
properties in herbs and beasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aristotle himself in his works upon natural science accepts
such properties to a considerable extent. A few citations
from his <cite>History of Animals</cite><a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a> will show that we have
not been misled in inferring from Pliny that Greek science
at its best was not untainted by magic. The <cite>History of
Animals</cite> seems to attribute undue influence to the full moon
and the dog-star,<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> and to hold that honey is distilled from
the air by the stars and that the wax alone is made by the
bees.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> Aristotle repeats the story that the salamander is a
fire-extinguisher.<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a> He mentions as a cure for the sting of
a certain snake the drinking of a small stone “taken from
the tomb of one of the ancient kings.” Like Pliny, he
makes human saliva a defense against serpents.<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a> He says
of certain things that they are ominous of certain events.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He affirms that the hen-partridge is affected by the mere
breath of the cock or by a breeze from his direction.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> He
thinks that insects are spontaneously generated from mud,
dung, wood, or flesh.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a> He says it is plain that the Narce
causes stupefaction in both fish and men.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a> He has not only
an idea that those with lice in their hair are less subject to
headaches, but also a notion that those who have lice and
take baths become more liable to the pest when they change
the water in which they wash themselves.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Another amusing
illusion which he records is that calves will suffer less
in their feet if their horns are waxed.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Thus the pages of
Aristotle give ground for belief that the fantasticalness of
mediæval science was due to “the clear light of Hellas”
as well as to the gloom of the “Dark Ages.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The book by a Roman which we are to consider as illustrative
of the condition of science before the age of the
Empire is Cato’s treatise on agriculture. Several passages
emphasize the importance of such conditions as that the
moon should be new or waning or not shining during the
performance of such acts as the transplanting of trees or
the manuring of meadows.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a> It is also directed that in administering
medicine to oxen the man giving the dose shall
have fasted previously and that both he and the ox stand
upright during the operation.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a> One medicine prescribed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>for cattle is a mixture of 3 grains of salt, 3 leaves of laurel,
3 fibres of leek, 3 tufts of ulpican leek, 3 sprigs of the savin,
3 leaves of rue, 3 stalks of the white vine, 3 white beans,
3 live coals, 3 sextarii of wine. Each ox is to be given a
portion for three days and the whole is to be divided so
that it will suffice for exactly three doses.<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a> To heal a sprain

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Belief in Magic in the Empire</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Having shown reason for believing that the <cite>Natural History</cite>
is a fairly accurate mirror of the science of the past,
we come now to examine Pliny’s own age and to observe
to what extent his attitude towards magic was characteristic
of it. “His own age,” I say, but this is only roughly
speaking, for it is the general period of the Roman Empire
that we shall now consider, with the exception of the closing
century which we reserve for later discussion. We
shall have now to speak first of the general attitude towards
magic in the Empire, and then in particular of two or three
men or works that corroborate the rich evidence which
Pliny, for the most part unconsciously, gave of the place
of magic in the intellectual life of the time.</p>

<p class='c010'>I. <em>General attitude.</em>—At the start, just as in our discussion
of the <cite>Natural History</cite>, we find it necessary to distinguish
the position of men towards what they called “magic.”
Pliny’s condemnation of the magi and of all their beliefs
as a matter of general principle was probably the regular
attitude. A stigma seems to have been attached to the word
“magic;” and magi seem to have been regarded as dangerous
characters. In his history Dio Cassius represents Mæcenas
as warning Octavius Cæsar that while the practice of divination
is necessary, and augury by sacrifices and flight of
birds an art to be encouraged, magicians ought to be entirely
done away with. For, telling the truth in some cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>but lying in more, they incite many persons to revolt.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a> The
prejudice in the Empire against magic is further illustrated
by the fact that pagan and Christian controversialists seldom
failed to impute to the opposing religion the practice of
this malign art.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now and then some learned man like Eudoxus might
hold that the doctrines of the magi of Persia called for
eulogy rather than reproach. Thus Apuleius, in his <cite>Defense</cite>
against the accusation of magic brought against him, explained
that <em>magus</em> in the Persian language was
equivalent to the Latin <i><span lang="la">sacerdos</span></i> or priest, and that,
among the four greatest men of the realm selected to educate
the heir to the Persian throne, one had the task of instructing
him in the magic of Zoroaster. This magic dealt
with “the rules of ceremonial, the due observance of things
sacred, the law of religious rites.”<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a> It was the cult of
the gods.</p>

<p class='c012'>Do you hear, you who rashly charge me with magic, that this art
is acceptable to the immortal gods, consists of celebrating and
reverencing them, is pious and prophetic, and long since was
held by Zoroaster and Oromagus, its authors, to be noble and
divine? Nay, it is included among the chief studies of royalty,
and the Persians no more think of rashly allowing any one to
become a magician than to become a king.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>But if his accusers mean magic in the popular sense, that is,
Apuleius grants, a different matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even educated men, however, probably more often, like
Pliny, regarded the magi as all one with other magicians.
Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius of Tyana, seems to
approximate much closer to this position than to that taken
by Apuleius, although one would expect a biographer of
that mystic personage to view the magi with favor. Philostratus
declares that Apollonius was no magician, although
he did associate with the magi of Babylonia, the Brahmins
of India, and the gymnosophists of Egypt. For he was
like Empedocles, Pythagoras, Democritus and Plato who frequented
those sects and yet did not embrace the (magic) art.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Of what we should call magic, however, there was a
plenty in the Roman Empire, as in fact the words of Dio
Cassius have indicated.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Besides the general acceptance of
divination there was a great deal of superstitious medicine.
There seems to be little room for doubt that Pliny’s diatribes
against the medical art were justifiable, and that his
own trust in marvelous medicinal properties of animals and
plants was often equalled. Men of the highest eminence in
public life, whom one would expect to have had at their
disposal the best medical talent of the time, are reported to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>have employed the most absurd remedies. Suetonius tells
us that the Emperor Augustus wore seal’s skin, his successor
Tiberius laurel leaves, as a protection against lightning.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
Pliny recounts how M. Servilius Nonianus, <i><span lang="la">princeps
civitatis</span></i>, fearing ophthalmia, had fastened to his neck
a piece of linen containing some paper on which were
written the Greek letters Ρ and Α. This was done before
any mention of the disease was allowed to be made to him
or by him. Mucianus, thrice consul, carried a live fly
around in a bit of white linen for a similar purpose, and of
course both men attributed their escape from disease to
these bizarre methods.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a> Moreover, much magic has been
supposed to have been involved in the numerous Mysteries
to which men sought initiation and in the Oriental cults
which became so popular. Astrology was seemingly as universally
cultivated as in the Middle Ages, and that, too,
though perhaps in Roman times it was in appearance less
of a science and more of a superstition.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were occasional imperial edicts against astrologers,
it is true, and even sporadic persecution of them. But the
explanation of such measures is belief, not scepticism, and
they denote not disbelief in the art itself but disapproval of
the use to which it was put—such as revealing the fate of
the present and the name of the coming ruler. Almost every
emperor had an astrologer at his court, and the historians
of the period delighted in telling stories of astrologers who
foretold their own deaths, or of monarchs who in vain
attempted to thwart the decrees of fate.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Alexander Severus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>is said to have founded chairs of astrology salaried
by the state and with provision for scholarships for students.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
Occasional persecution perhaps made the <i><span lang="la">mathematici</span></i> more
highly valued, and the jibes of the satirists against astrologers
and their followers attest rather than disprove the
popularity of the art. Pliny the Elder and Tacitus asserted
its great currency.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The best science of the Empire reflected to a considerable
extent these superstitions sanctioned by public opinion, as
our discussion of Seneca and Ptolemy will indicate in some
detail. For the present we may observe how the great
Galen—whose authority reduced to a single school the many
quarreling medical sects of his day, was later implicitly
accepted by the Arabs, and then dominated European medicine
to the time of Paracelsus—was not above astrological
medicine or the use of fantastical remedies. He displayed
trust in amulets and believed that such things as the ashes
of frogs or “hippocampi” have remedial power.<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> He held
that the critical days of disease are largely influenced by the
moon, and affirmed that we receive “the force of all the stars
above.”<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a> It should be noted moreover that in one passage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>in giving expression to his zeal for astronomy as the handmaid
of the healing art, Galen accused many physicians of
paying no attention to the stars. But he asserted that
in this neglect they were no true followers of the great
Hippocrates, whom they extolled but never imitated, for
Hippocrates had maintained that astronomy had no small
bearing on the art of the physician and that geometry was
its indispensable precursor.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Philosophy as well as science was not unfavorable to some
varieties of magic. Neo-Platonism, the most prominent
school of philosophy in the Empire, probably led men on
to belief in magic more than any previous classical system.
Nature was looked upon as real only in so far as it was
soul, and its processes were regarded as the expression of
the world-soul’s mysterious working. The investigation of
nature thus tended to become an inquiry concerning spirits
and demons, a study into the strange and subtle relations
existing between things united, as all things are, by bonds
of spiritual sympathy. True, the earlier Alexandrines are
said to have condemned magic arts,<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a> but we have seen that
such condemnation need not amount to much. Plotinus
attacked only the most extreme pretensions of astrology,
and was ready to grant that the stars were celestial characters
and signs of the future. He even conceded that prediction
might be made from birds. But to him astrology and
augury seemed of comparatively small importance, for he
believed everything to be joined to and dependent upon
every other thing and that in any object the wise man might
see signs of everything else.<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Succeeding Neo-Platonists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>at any rate, were often devoted to magic. The name of
Iamblichus, for instance, is one of the most prominent in
the field of the occult.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, in the time of the Empire a tendency was
noticeable to confuse philosophy with magic. If this tendency
was not justifiable, it is at least suggestive. Dio
Cassius, in the passage above quoted, represents Mæcenas
as saying that not a few of those who pretend to be philosophers
practice magic.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Apuleius, accused of magic,
stated in his <cite>Apologia</cite> that he was undertaking not only his
own defense but that of philosophy.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a> The accusation
against him also suggests similar charges brought against
mediæval men of learning during their lives or reputations
which they won after death. Apuleius, having married a
rich widow older than himself, was charged by some sycophant,
jealous rival or other personal enemy with having
obtained her affections by use of sorcery. Apuleius seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to have studied medicine, if no other branch of physical
science, for he asserts that certain verses laid to his charge
by the accuser deal with nothing more harmful than a recipe
for making tooth-powder, and that a woman whom he was
said to have bewitched had merely fallen into an epileptic
fit while consulting him concerning an ear-ache.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a> This
might be taken to show that the pursuit of science was
already liable to give one a bad reputation as a wizard; but
it should be said that the love-verses of Apuleius, as well as
his poetical prescriptions, were used to support the accusation,
and that the purchase of fish was also brought forward
as a suspicious circumstance. Apuleius affirms in his oration
that “philosophers” have always been subjected to such
charges. He says, however, that the investigators of physical
causes like Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus
generally have the epithet atheist cast in their teeth,
while it is the seekers into the mysteries of theology and
religion like Epimenides, Orpheus, Pythagoras and Ostanes
who are reputed to be magi.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>II. <em>Philo of Alexandria and allegorical interpretation.</em>—Allegorical
interpretation, unless of a very mild character,
is usually a fantastic and mystical method of deriving information
or inspiration. Even if an author intended to
conceal secret mysteries beneath the letter of his text, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>is very slight chance that the far-fetched and intricate mode
of solution employed by the interpreter will be the one
which the writer had in mind. In most cases, however,
after due allowance has been made for figures of speech
and play of poetical imagination, it is an erroneous and
absurd assumption to suppose that an author did not mean
what his language indicates and no more. Therefore the
believer in allegorical interpretation would seem to be accepting
something quite like a magical doctrine. Indeed,
allegorical interpretation is liable to lead one into a belief
that words, besides possessing a mystical significance with
which the thought of their writer had endowed them, have
in and of themselves great power. It borders upon the
occult reveries of the Cabalists and upon that magic power
of words which we have seen upheld by Roger Bacon, John
Reuchlin and Henry Cornelius Agrippa.</p>

<p class='c010'>This allegorical interpretation of literature has played a
great part in human history. It was rife in the age of the
Roman Empire, when Philo Judaeus of Alexandria (approximate
date, 30 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> to 54 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>) was perhaps its greatest
exponent, as he was also the chief member of the Jewish-Alexandrian
school of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Philo carried allegorical interpretation to an absurd extreme
even if he did not go quite so far as Reuchlin and
Agrippa. Not only did he make such assertions as that by
Hagar was typified “encyclical education,” that Ishmael
was her “sophist son,” and that Sarah stood for “the ruling
virtue,”<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a> but in general he tried to read into the Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Testament all the doctrines of Greek philosophy and science.
He declared that all knowledge, whether in religion, philosophy
or natural science, might be acquired by allegorical
interpretation of the Pentateuch. Now we can say without
manifesting any semblance of irreverence towards true religion,
that to endeavor to gain from the books of the Old
Testament—especially by the methods which Philo employed—either
the key to all philosophy or adequate knowledge of
natural science and extensive control of the forces of nature,
would, if possible, be as marvelous a feat, and is as fallacious
and fantastic a proceeding, as to try to coin gold from
copper, or to learn the future from the stars, or even to
obtain a solution of the problems of philosophy and a
knowledge and control of nature by invoking demons to instruct
and to assist you. The very notion that some man
like Moses a thousand or more years ago had at his command
all the knowledge that can ever be got is magical itself.
Moses must have been a magician to know so much. Philo,
moreover, if he did not believe in a magic power of words,
at least showed that they seemed to him to have a most
extraordinary significance. In his treatise, <cite>De Mutatione
Nominum</cite>, he relates with great unction the just punishment
of hanging which overtook an impious scoffer who
derided the notion that the change in the names of Abraham
and of Sarah had any profound meaning.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a> As one would
naturally expect from what has been said about Philo thus
far, he regarded knowledge as something sacred and esoteric.
In his writings he liked to talk of mysteries and to
request the uninitiated to withdraw. This attitude, while
in itself not exactly magic, is, as has been already suggested,
the product of a mind attuned to magic. Finally, Philo, following
Pythagoras, attached great significance to numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Philo not only represents a widespread tendency during
the Roman Empire, but probably well illustrates the influence
of that tendency upon later times. His numerous
works were apparently much consulted by the church
fathers, and thereby exerted a strong influence upon the
Middle Ages. It is needless to enlarge upon the prominence
of allegorical interpretation in the works of mediæval
ecclesiastical writers. The conception of knowledge as
esoteric was also prevalent then, though perhaps to a less
extent. To give an early instance from patristic literature,
Clement of Alexandria, in his <cite>Stromata</cite>, insists upon the
necessity of veiling divine truth in allegories, and has a
long discussion in favor of mysticism in learning, citing as
examples Greek philosophers as well as Hebrew writers.<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a>
Moreover, to Philo as source we may trace back the disquisitions
upon the mystic, if not magic, properties of six and
other numbers which we find in Augustine<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a> and apparently
in almost every mediæval writer who had occasion to speak
of the six days of creation and of the seventh day of rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>III. <em>Seneca’s Problems of Nature and divination.</em>—We
shall next consider the <cite>Problems of Nature</cite>—or <cite>Natural
Questions</cite>, if one prefers merely to transcribe the Latin—of
Seneca, who was practically a contemporary of Pliny.
Seneca impresses one as a favorable representative of ancient
science. He tells us that already in his youth he had
written a treatise on earthquakes and their causes.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a> His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>aim is to inquire into the natural causes of phenomena; he
wants to know why things are so. He is aware that his
own age has only entered the vestibule of the knowledge
of natural phenomena and forces, that it has but just begun
to know five of the many stars, that “there will come a
time when our descendants will wonder that we were ignorant
of matters so evident.”<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>One must admit, however, that along with Seneca’s consciousness
of the very imperfect knowledge of his own age
there goes a tendency to esotericism. The following language
would come fittingly from the mouth of a magician:</p>

<p class='c012'>There are sacred things which are not revealed all at once.
Eleusis reserves sights for those who revisit her. Nature does
not disclose her mysteries in a moment. We think ourselves
initiated; we stand but at her portal. Those secrets open not
promiscuously nor to every comer. They are remote of access,
enshrined in the inner sanctuary.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Seneca seems to regard scientific research as a sort of religious
exercise. His enthusiasm in the study of natural
forces appears largely due to the fact that he believes them
to be of a sublime and divine character, and above the petty
affairs of men.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Indeed, the phenomena which he discusses are mainly
meteorological manifestations, such as winds, rain, hail,
snow, comets, rainbows, and—what he regards as allied subjects—earthquakes,
springs and rivers. Probably he would
not have regarded the study of zoölogy or of physiology as
so sublime. At any rate he considers only a comparatively
few “natural questions,” and hence the amount and variety
of belief in magic which he has occasion to display is correspondingly
limited.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is evident enough, however, that Seneca by no means
accepted magic as a whole. He tells us that uncivilized
antiquity believed that rain could be brought on or driven
away by incantations, but that to-day no one needs a philosopher
to teach him that this is impossible.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a> And, although
he affirms that living beings are generated in fire,
believes in some rather peculiar effects of lightning, such
as removing the venom from snakes which it strikes, and
recounts the old stories of floating islands and of waters
with power to turn white sheep black, he is sceptical about
bathing in the waters of the Nile as a means of increasing
the female’s capacity for child-bearing.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a> He qualifies by
the phrases, “it is believed” and “they say,” the assertions
that certain waters produce foul skin-diseases and that
dew in particular, if collected in any quantity, has this evil
property.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a> I imagine he did not believe the story he repeats
that the river Alphæus of Greece reappears in Sicily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>as the Arethusa, and there every four years, on the very
days when the victims are slaughtered at the Olympian
games, casts up filth from its depths.<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a> The themes Seneca
discusses of course afford him less opportunity for the taking
up of the magic properties of plants, animals and other
objects, but he was probably less credulous in this respect
than Pliny, unless his pretensions are even more deceptive.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seneca did believe, however, that whatever is caused is
a sign of some future event.<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a> He accepts divination in all
its ramifications. Only he holds that each flight of a bird
is not caused by direct act of God nor the vitals of the
victim altered under the axe by divine interference, but
that all has been arranged beforehand in a fatal and causal
series.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a> He believes that all unusual celestial phenomena
are to be looked upon as prodigies and portents.<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a> But no
less truly do the planets in their unvarying courses signify
the future. The stars are of divine nature and we ought
to approach the discussion of them with as reverent an air
as when with lowered countenance we enter the temples for
worship.<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Not only do the stars influence our upper atmosphere
as earth’s exhalations affect the lower, but they announce
what is to occur.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Seneca employs the statement of
Aristotle that comets signify the coming of storms and
winds and foul weather, to prove that comets are stars;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and declares that a comet is a portent of a storm in the
same way as the Chaldeans say that a star brings good or
ill fate to men at birth.<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c011'><sup>[178]</sup></a> In fact, his chief, if not sole, objection
to the Chaldeans would seem to be that in their predictions
they take into account only five stars.</p>

<p class='c012'>What? Think you so many thousand stars shine on in vain?
What else, indeed, is it which causes those skilled in nativities
to err than that they assign us to a few stars, although all those
that are above us have a share in the control of our fate?
Perhaps those nearer direct their influence upon us more
closely; perhaps those of more rapid motion look down on us
and other animals from more varied aspects. But even those
stars that are motionless, or because of their speed keep equal
pace with the rest of the universe and seem not to move, are
not without rule and dominion over us.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c011'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Seneca accepts a theory of Berosus, whose acquaintance we
have already made, that whenever all the stars are in conjunction
in the sign of Cancer there will be a universal
conflagration, and a second deluge when they all unite in
Capricorn.<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It is on thunderbolts as portents of the future that Seneca
dwells longest, however. “They give,” he declares, “not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>signs of this or that event merely, but often announce a
whole series of events destined to occur, and that by manifest
decrees and ones far clearer than if they were set down
in writing.”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a> He will not, however, accept the theory that
lightning has such great power that its intervention nullifies
any previous and contradictory portents. He insists that
divination by other methods is of equal truth, though perhaps
of minor importance and significance. Next he attempts
to explain how dangers of which we are warned by
divination may be averted by prayer, expiation or sacrifice,
and yet the chain of events wrought by destiny not be
broken. He maintains that just as we employ the services
of doctors to preserve our health, despite any belief we may
have in fate, so it is useful to consult a <i><span lang="la">haruspex</span></i>. Then he
goes on to speak of various classifications of thunderbolts
according to the nature of the warnings or encouragements
which they bring.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>IV. <em>Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos and astrology.</em>—Astrology was
more than a popular belief which extended to men high in
social rank and public life; it was held by scientists as well,
though naturally in a less naïve and more scientific form.
Nevertheless, the astrology of the scientist might be of an
extreme enough type and of a more clearly magical variety
than we were able to gather from Pliny, who, moreover,
does not seem to have been acquainted with any systematic
doctrine of the influence of the stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a systematized treatment Claudius Ptolemaeus set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>forth in the little volume known as the <cite>Tetrabiblos</cite>, or
<cite>Quadripartitum</cite>. It would seem as if we ought to be able
to regard a book by that noted geographer and astronomer
as an example of the best science of his time, the middle of
the second century. His works quickly became classics, and
in the third century Porphyry commented on the <cite>Tetrabiblos</cite>.
The Arabs eagerly accepted his writings, and it is generally
held that in the Middle Ages his word was law in all the
subjects of which he treated. The <cite>Tetrabiblos</cite>, therefore,
would seem a landmark in the entire history of astrology
as well as a crucial instance of how that branch of magic
formed a part of science in the Roman Empire. True,
Ptolemy does not cover the whole field of sidereal influence.
He limits himself to the effects of the stars on man and
does not attempt to trace out how they affect all varieties
of matter and of life upon our globe. However, to make
the stars control each individual man is the climax of
astrology and implies that the heavenly bodies govern everything
else here on earth. So the <cite>Tetrabiblos</cite> is a very satisfactory
instance of belief in astrology by a scientist and its
contents may well be briefly considered.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The first of the four books opens with the trite contention
that the art itself is not to be rejected because frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>abused by imposters, and with the admission that
even the skilful investigator often makes mistakes owing to
the incompleteness of human knowledge. In the first place,
our doctrine of the nature of matter rests, Ptolemy says, more
on conjecture than on certain knowledge. Secondly, old configurations
of the stars cannot be safely used as the basis of
present-day predictions. Indeed, so many are the different
possible positions of the stars and the different possible
arrangements of terrestrial matter in relation to the stars
that it is difficult to collect enough instances on which to
base judgment. Moreover, such things as diversity of place,
of education and of custom must be reckoned with in foretelling
the future of persons born under the same stars.
But although predictions frequently fail, yet the art is not
to be condemned any more than one rejects the art of navigation
because of frequent shipwrecks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far one might take Ptolemy for a well-balanced and
accurate scientist in the modern sense of the term, but he
does not maintain this level. After showing that it is useful
to know the future and that astrology does not depend
on fatal necessity, he proceeds to explain why the stars give
knowledge of the future. This he intends to show from
natural causes: <i><span lang="la">ubique naturalium causarum rationem sequentes</span></i>.
This sounds well but his reasoning is superficial
and childish, as his discussion of the influence exercised by
the planets will indicate.</p>

<p class='c010'>In each planet one of the four elemental qualities predominates
(or perhaps two divide the supremacy) and endows
the star with a peculiar nature and power. The sun
warms and, to some extent, makes dry, for the nearer it
comes to our pole the more heat and drought it produces.
The moon, on the contrary, causes humidity, since it is
close to the earth and gets the effect of vapors from
the latter. Evidently the moon influences other bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>in this way, rendering them soft and producing putrefaction.
It also warms a little owing to the light it receives
from the sun. Saturn, however, chills and, to some extent,
dries, for it is very far from the heat of the sun and the
damp mists of the earth. Mars emits a parching heat,
as its color and proximity to the sun lead one to infer.
Jupiter, situated between cold Saturn and burning Mars, is
of a sort of lukewarm nature, but tends more to warmth
and moisture than to the other two qualities. So does
Venus, but conversely, for it warms less than Jupiter but
makes moist more, since its large area catches many damp
vapors from the neighboring earth. In Mercury, situated
near the sun, moon and earth, neither drought nor dampness
predominates; but that planet, incited by its own velocity,
is a potent cause of sudden changes. In general, the
planets are of good or evil influence according as they
abound in the two rich and vivifying qualities, heat and
moisture, or in the detrimental and destructive ones, cold
and drought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ptolemy then goes on to discuss the powers of fixed stars.
These powers he would seem to make depend chiefly on the
relation of the fixed star to the planets or on its position in
some constellation. Then he treats of the influence of the
seasons and of the four cardinal points, to each of
which he assigns some one predominating quality. A
discussion of the importance of such things as the twelve
signs of the zodiac, the twelve “houses,” the <cite>Trigones</cite>
(equilateral triangles each comprising three signs of the
zodiac), and the position of the star in reference to the
horizon, ends the first book and also the presentation of
fundamental considerations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other three books contain “doctrinam de praedictione
singularium.” The second book, however, deals in the
main with four points of general though subordinate bearing:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>under what stars different regions belong, how the
effects of the stars vary according to time as well as place,
how the heavenly bodies influence the nature of events, and
finally how they determine their quality, good or bad. The
third and fourth books, besides taking up separately the
particular effects of each planet as it enters into conjunction
with each of the others, comprise chapters with such headings
as the following: “<i><span lang="la">de parentibus</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de fratribus</span></i>,”
“<i><span lang="la">de masculis et femellis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de geminis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de natis qui
nutrire non possunt sed mox extinguuntur</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de dignitate</span></i>,”
“<i><span lang="la">de magisterio</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de coniugiis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de liberis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de amicis
et inimicis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de servis</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de perigrinatione</span></i>,” “<i><span lang="la">de genere
mortis</span></i>.” These two books discuss how length of years, fortune,
diseases, and various qualities of body and mind may
be predicted from the stars; in short, how man’s entire life
is ordered by the constellations. Such is the book which
Bouché-Leclercq calls “science’s surrender.”<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>V. <em>The hermetic books and occultism.</em>—An account of
belief in magic in the Roman Empire would be incomplete
without some reference to the famous hermetic books.
Hermes Trismegistus might, as deservedly as any other
man—had he only been a man and not a myth—be called
the father of magic, just as he used to be known as the
father of Egyptian science and just as he was regarded by
many as the inventor of all philosophy.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a> In the time of
Plato the Egyptian god Thoth acquired the name of Hermes
from the similarity of his functions to those of the
Greek god. He also came to be considered as the author
of pretty much all knowledge and was given the epithet of
“Thrice Great.” The entire body of Egyptian occult lore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>was attributed to him, and Manetho, who pictured him as
reigning over the ancient Egyptians, declared that in addition
to his royal duties he succeeded in turning off some
36,000 volumes. Clement of Alexandria, however, speaks
of but forty-two books as “indispensably necessary,” and
says that the priests having charge of the hermetic books,
by memorizing these forty-two, cover the entire philosophy
of the Egyptians.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Diocletian is said to have dispersed the
priests and burned their books, because he came to the conclusion
that the frequent revolts in the locality received
pecuniary aid by means of gold artificially manufactured
in the temples.<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a> Before that, however, lore supposed
to be similar to that contained within the books had become
disseminated. In the days of Hadrian and the Antonines,
Jews and other Orientals at Rome offered to initiate
persons into those occult sciences previously the monopoly
of the Egyptian priesthood. Marcus Aurelius, in his later
years, was thus instructed by an Egyptian diviner, who followed
him in all his campaigns.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a> Also the custom grew
up rather early of passing off works on occult subjects
under Hermes’ name and of ascribing to him all such books
which were of doubtful authorship. Of alchemy was this
tendency especially true, so that it came to be known as the
hermetic art. Sosimus, Stephanus and other Greek writers
cited alchemical treatises under Hermes’ name, and the practice
of publishing spurious hermetic books continued well into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the Middle Ages.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> Several such alchemical treatises are
still extant; and writings on astrological medicine and the
magical powers of gems, plants and animals have also come
down to us under Hermes’ name.<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the supposed writings of Hermes were mystical
rather than magical; for instance, the famous <cite>Poemander</cite>,<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
which consists mainly of brief and disconnected utterances
concerning God and the human soul and other subjects of
a religious character. Still, one does not have to read far
into its sixteen “books” before finding evidence of belief in
astrology, of the mysticism of number and of an esoteric view
of knowledge. It tells us “to avoid all conversation with
the multitude” and to “take heed of them as not understanding
the virtue and power of the things that are said.”
It speaks frequently of the seven circles of heaven, the seven
zones, and the seven “Governors.” It affirms that “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars with all their
signs, and the stars were numbered with the Gods in
them.” Hence, it is probably safe enough, when, for instance,
we hear that Theon, father of Hypatia, celebrated in
his day as a mathematician, and professor at the Alexandrian
Museum, lectured upon the writings of Hermes Trismegistus
and of Orpheus<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a>—another legendary worthy
charged with works of an occult character—to conclude
that we have met one more case of the mingling of magic
with learning.</p>

<p class='c010'>In short, then, the mythical figure of Hermes Trismegistus
became an actuating ideal to the Middle Ages, and the
works appearing under his name had a considerable influence
in extending belief in magic. Secondly, the hermetic
books serve to typify that mass of Eastern occult philosophy
and occult science which was so strong a force in the mental
life of the Roman Empire.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>Critics of Magic</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The reader will remember how men in the Roman Empire
condemned “magic” but understood the word in a
restricted and bad sense; how Pliny made pretensions to
complete freedom from all belief in magic and how inconsistent
was his actual attitude; how Seneca rejected magic
only in part, accepting divination in all its ramifications.
This partial rejection and partial acceptance of magic by
the same individual seem characteristic of the age of the
Empire, as one would expect of a time when magic was in
a state of decay and science in a process of development.
It is true that this rejection of certain varieties of magic
often proceeded from the motive of morality rather than of
scepticism. Thus in Cicero’s <cite>De Divinatione</cite>, Quintus
Cicero is represented as closing his long argument in favor
of the truth of divination by solemnly asserting that he
does not approve of sorcerers, nor of those who prophesy
for sake of gain, nor of the practice of questioning spirits
of the dead—which nevertheless, he says, was a custom of
his brother’s friend Appius.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> But there were some men,
we may well believe, who would reject even those varieties
of magic which found a welcome in the minds of most educated
people and in the general mass of the thought and
science of the age. Such cases we shall now consider.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>I. <em>Opponents of astrology.</em>—Astrology, as we have seen,
was very popular. Yet there was some scepticism as to its
truth beyond the ridicule of satirists, who perhaps at bottom
were themselves believers in the art. Outside of Christian
writers the three chief opponents of astrology in the
Roman world, judging by the works that have come down
to us, were Cicero—who lived before the Empire in the
constitutional sense can be said to have begun—in his <cite>De
Divinatione</cite>; Favorinus, a Gaul who resided at Rome in the
reigns of Hadrian and Trajan, and was a friend of Plutarch,
and whose arguments against astrology have been
preserved only in the pages of Aulus Gellius; and Sextus
Empiricus, a physician who flourished at about the beginning
of the third century of our era.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>When, however, we come to examine both the men and
their arguments, we somehow do not find their assault upon
astrology especially impressive or satisfactory. First, as to
the men. Gellius says that he heard Favorinus make the
speech the substance of which he repeats, but that he is unable
to state whether the philosopher really meant what he
said or argued merely in order to exercise and to display
his genius.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> There was reason for this perplexity of Gellius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>since Favorinus was fond of writing such essays as
Eulogies of Thersites and of Quartan Fever. There is no
particular reason for doubting Sextus’s seriousness, but, besides
being a medical man, he was a member of the sceptical
school of philosophy, a circumstance which warns one not
to attribute too much emphasis to his attack on astrology.
Indeed, the attack occurs in a work directed against learning
in general, in which he assails grammarians, rhetoricians,
geometricians, arithmeticians, students of music,
logicians, “physicists,” and students of ethics as well as
astrologers. Cicero was not prone to such sweeping scepticism
or sophistry, but the force of his opposition to astrology
is somewhat neutralized by the fact that in his <cite>Dream
of Scipio</cite> he apparently attributes to planets influence over
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now as to their arguments. We have spoken of their
“attack on astrology,” but in reality they can scarcely be
said to attack astrology as a whole. Indeed, it is the doctrines
of the Chaldeans which Cicero makes the object of
his assault; he says nothing about astrology. Favorinus
will not even admit that he attacks the “disciplina Chaldaeorum”
in any true sense, but affirms that the Chaldeans
were not the authors of such theories at all, but that these
have originated of late among traveling fakirs who beg
their bread by means of such deceits and trickeries.<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a> Some
of the arguments of our sceptics are really directed merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>against the methods of interpreting the decrees of the stars
which they give us to understand that the astrologers employ.
Such objections might suffice to pierce the presumption of
the ordinary popular astrologer but they fall back blunted
from the system of Ptolemy.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a> If our sceptics thought that
they were overthrowing the astrology of the man of learning
by such arguments, they labored under a misapprehension,
and in the eyes of one who really understood the art
must have cut the figure of ignoramuses making false
charges against a science of which they knew next to
nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>As some of the arguments of our sceptics apply solely to
defects in method of which the best astrologers were not
guilty, so others do not deny the existence of sidereal influence
over the life of man, but contend that it is impossible
to determine with essential accuracy what will be the effects
of that influence. Sextus, for example, seems to lay most
stress upon such points as the difficulty of exactly determining
the date of birth or of conception, or the precise moment
when a star passes into a new sign of the zodiac. He calls
attention to the fact that observers at varying altitudes, as
well as in different localities, would arrive at different conclusions,
that differences in eyesight would also affect results,
and that it is hard to tell just when the sun sets owing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to refraction.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a> He almost becomes scholastic in the minuteness
of his objections, leaving us somewhat in doubt whether
they are to be taken as indicative of a spirit of captious
criticism towards an art the fundamental principles of which
he tacitly recognized as well-nigh incontestible, or whether
he is simply trying to make his case doubly sure by showing
astrology to be impracticable as well as unreasonable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main thing to be noted about Cicero, Favorinus and
Sextus is that they pay almost no attention to the general
problem of sidereal influence on terrestrial matter and life.
It is to the denial of an absolute, complete and immutable
rule of the heavenly bodies over man that they devote their
energies. The premises of astrology they leave pretty much
alone. One might accept almost all their statements and
still believe in a large influence of the stars over our physical
characteristics and mental traits. The question of
sidereal influence upon lower animal life, vegetation and
inert matter they avoid with a sneer.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c011'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>II. <em>Cicero’s attack upon divination.</em>—A more satisfactory
example of scepticism may be found in other chapters of
the <cite>De Divinatione</cite> than those which assail the art of the
Chaldeans. Moreover, although the discussion is limited
to the specific theme of divination, still that is a subject
which admits of very broad interpretation, and Cicero employs
some arguments which are capable of an even wider
application and oppose the hypotheses on which magic in
general rests. He rejects divination as unscientific. It is
to such arguments that we shall confine our attention.
“Natural divination,” that is, predictions made under direct
divine inspiration without interposition of signs and portents,
is not magic and so the discussion of it will not concern
us. Much less shall we waste any time over such trite
contentions against divination in general as that there is no
use of knowing predetermined events since you cannot avoid
them,<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a> and that even if we can learn the future we shall be
happier not to do it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><i><span lang="la">De Divinatione</span></i> takes the form of a suppositious conversation,
or better, informal debate, between the author and
his brother Quintus. In the first book Quintus, in a rather
rambling and leisurely fashion, and with occasional repetition
of ideas, upholds divination to the best of his ability,
citing many reported instances of successful recourse to it
in antiquity. In the second book Tully proceeds, with an
air of somewhat patronizing superiority, to pull entirely to
pieces the arguments of his brother, who assents with cheerful
readiness to their demolition.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is interesting to note that as Pliny’s magic was not his
own, so Cicero’s scepticism did not originate wholly with
himself. As his other philosophical writings draw their
material largely from Greek philosophy, so the second book
of the <cite>De Divinatione</cite> is supposed to have been under considerable
obligations to Clitomachus and Panætius.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a> As
for the future, the <cite>De Divinatione</cite> was known in the Middle
Ages but its influence seems to have often been scarcely that
intended by its author.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the main points in the argument of Quintus had
been his appeal to the past. What race or state, he asked,
has not believed in some form of divination?</p>

<p class='c012'>For before the revelation of philosophy, which was discovered
recently, public opinion had no doubt of the truth of this art;
and after philosophy came forth no philosopher of authority
thought otherwise. I have mentioned Pythagoras, Democritus,
Socrates. I have left out no one of the ancients save Xenophanes.
I have added the Old Academy, the Peripatetics, the
Stoics. Epicurus alone dissented.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>When Tully’s turn to speak came, he rudely disturbed
his brother’s reliance upon tradition. “I think it not the
part of a philosopher to employ witnesses, who are only
haply true, often purposely false and deceiving. He ought
to show why a thing is so by arguments and reasons, not
by events, especially those I cannot credit.”<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a> “Antiquity,”
Cicero declared later, “has erred in many respects.”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The
existence of the art of divination in every age and nation
had little effect upon him. There is nothing, he asserted, so
widespread as ignorance.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Both brothers distinguished divination from the natural
sciences and assigned it a place by itself.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Quintus said that
medical men, pilots and farmers foresee many things, yet
their arts are not divination. “Not even Pherecydes, that
famous Pythagorean master, who prophesied an earthquake
when he saw there was no water in a well usually full,
should be regarded as a diviner rather than a physicist.”<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
In like manner Tully pointed out that the sick seek a doctor,
not a soothsayer, that diviners cannot instruct us in astronomy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that no one consults them concerning philosophic
problems or ethical questions, that they can give us no light
on the problems of the natural universe, and that they are
of no service in logic, dialectic or political science.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Such
would be the ideal condition, but in practice, as we have
seen much reason to believe, divination, at least in the broad
sense, was confused with science and with other subjects to
no small extent both under the Empire and in the Middle
Ages. A doctor might be something of a diviner as well: the
astrologer was skilled in astronomy; “mathematicus” came
within a short time after Cicero’s own day to be the word
regularly used to denote a soothsayer;<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Pierre du Bois and
Bodin found astrology an aid to political science.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cicero, however, went further than the assertion that
divination had no connection with science and declared that
it was contrary to science. Such a figment, he scornfully
affirmed, as that the heart will vanish from a corpse for one
man’s benefit and remain in the body to suit the future of
another, was not believed even by old wives now-a-days.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
Nay more, he asked, how can the heart vanish from the
body? Surely it must be there while life lasts, and can it
disappear in an instant?</p>

<p class='c012'>Believe me, you are abandoning the citadel of philosophy
while you defend its outposts. For in your effort to prove
soothsaying true you utterly pervert physiology.... For there
will be something which either springs from nothing or suddenly
vanishes into nothingness. What scientist ever said that?
The soothsayers say so? Are they then, do you think, to
be trusted rather than scientists?<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Cicero does not think they are.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Also he shows that the methods of divination are not
scientific. He asks: Why did Calchas deduce from the
devoured sparrow that the Trojan war would last ten years
rather than ten weeks or ten months?<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c011'><sup>[212]</sup></a> He points out that
the art is conducted in different places according to quite
different rules of procedure, even to the extent that a favorable
omen in one locality is a sinister warning elsewhere.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c011'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
In short, whether he got his idea from the Greeks or not,
he has come, long before most men had reached that point,
to have a clear idea of the essential contradiction between
science and magic. “Quid igitur,” he asks, “minus a
physicis dici debet quam quidquam certi significari rebus
incertis?”<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c011'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Besides this sharp separation of divination from science
and besides his rejection of tradition, a third creditable
feature of Cicero’s book is his question: What intimate
connection, what bond of natural causality can there be between
the liver or heart or lung of a fat bull and the divine
eternal cause of things which rules the world?<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a> He refuses
to believe in any extraordinary bonds of sympathy
between things which, in so far as our daily experience and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>our knowledge of nature’s workings can inform us, have
absolutely no connection. He appeals to the canons of
common sense. In fact, it is generally true throughout his
treatise that where he cannot disprove, he pooh-poohs superstition.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole Cicero’s attitude probably represents the
most enlightened scepticism to be found in the ancient world.
Though some of his arguments seem weak, he deserves
credit for having argued at all. Against what they were
pleased to call magic, men, especially during the Middle
Ages, were apt to rant rather than reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, alas, unless we assume that the famous <cite>Dream of
Scipio</cite> is a purely imaginative production, that the fantastic
beliefs there set forth (borrowed, no doubt, from Greek
thought) are presented for dramatic purposes alone and do
not represent Cicero’s actual views, we must grant that our
sceptical Cicero believed in some magic after all. For the
<cite>Dream</cite>, despite its author’s animadversions against Chaldæan
astrology, speaks of Jupiter as a star wholesome and
favorable to the human race, of Mars as most unfavorable.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
Also it calls the numbers seven and eight perfect and speaks
of their product as signifying the fatal year in Scipio’s
career.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Last Century of the Empire</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We come now to consider some indications of the intermixture
of magic with learning in the last century of the
Roman Empire, the border-time of the Middle Ages. It
was a time when interest in science was slight and when
the ability to use florid rhetoric was apparently the chief
aim of those who assumed to be the highest intellectual
class. What science there was was largely permeated with
magic, as a glance at a few men of intellectual prominence
then will illustrate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marcellus of Bordeaux, court physician of Theodosius I,
and a writer upon medicine, throws some light upon the
state of medicine in his day. He affirmed that pimples
might be removed by wiping them the instant you saw a
falling-star. He said that a tumor could be cured if one
half of a root of vervain were tied about the sufferer’s neck
and the other half suspended over a fire. His theory was
that as the vervain dried up in the smoke of the fire, the
tumor would by force of magic sympathy likewise dry up
and disappear. Marcellus added for the benefit of unpaid
physicians that so persistent would be the sympathetic bond
established that if the root of the vervain were later thrown
into water, its absorption of moisture would produce a return
of the tumor.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c011'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote at the close of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>fourth century, and who has been regarded by his critics
from Gibbon down as a historian of distinguished merit,
gives us an idea of mental conditions in his time, and was
himself not free from belief in magic. It is true that in declaiming
against the degeneracy of the Roman aristocracy
he ridicules their trust in astrology, saying that many of
them deny the existence of higher powers in heaven, yet
think it imprudent to appear in public or dine or take a bath
without first having consulted an almanac as to Mercury’s
whereabouts or the exact position of the moon in Cancer.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c011'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Yet he believed in omens, portents and auspices, as the following
citations will indicate and as one might show by
other passages.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first passage is one in which Ammianus speaks of
Alexandria as formerly having been a great place of learning
and as even in his degenerate days a considerable intellectual
centre. According to him, it is a sufficient recommendation
for any medical man if he say that he was
educated at Alexandria.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c011'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>There whatever lies hidden is laid bare by geometry; music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>is not utterly forgotten nor harmony neglected; among some
men, though their number may not be great, the motion of the
world and stars is still a matter of consideration; there are
not a few of those skilled in numbers.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is not all. “Besides these things they cherish the
science which reveals the decrees of fate.”<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c011'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Emperor Julian was continually inspecting entrails
of victims and interpreting dreams and omens, and even
proposed to reopen a prophetic fountain which Hadrian
was said to have blocked up for fear that others, like himself,
might win the imperial throne through obedience to
its predictions.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c011'><sup>[222]</sup></a> The mention of such practices of Julian
leads Ammianus in another passage to attempt a justification
of divination as a science worthy of the study and respect
of the most erudite and intelligent. He says:</p>

<p class='c012'>Inasmuch as to this ruler, who was a man of culture and an
inquirer into all branches of learning, malicious persons have
attributed the use of evil arts to learn the future, we shall
briefly indicate how a wise man is able to acquire this by no
means trivial variety of knowledge. The spirit behind all the
elements, seeing that it is incessantly and everywhere active
in the prophetic movement of everlasting bodies, bestows upon
us the gift of divination by those methods which we acquire
through divers studies; and the forces of nature, propitiated
by various rites, as from exhaustless springs provide mankind
with prophetic utterances.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c011'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>That is, we can foreknow, if not control, the results of the
processes of universal nature. Since it is through the
forces of nature that we do this, augury, oracular utterances,
oneiromancy and astrology all become for Ammianus
but subdivisions of physical science. He admits that there
are persons who disagree with him, who object that predictions
are often erroneous; but against such persons he
employs the old refutation that occasional mistakes are to
be attributed to man’s imperfect knowledge and faulty observation,
and that by such mistakes the validity of divination
is no more disproved than is grammar forever discredited
because a grammarian speaks incorrectly, or music
because a musician sings out of tune.<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c011'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Opposition to the
arts of divination he calls “vanities plebeia,” and upon such
loud-mouthed ignorance of the vulgar he looks down
with much the same superior smile that the lover of speculative
philosophy to-day bestows upon the man in the street
who irritably disputes the utility of that subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed, the strength of Ammianus’s attachment to divination
is so great that he quotes its arch-opponent, Cicero,
in its support. For he concludes his discussion of the subject
in these words: “Wherefore in this as in other matters
Tully says most admirably, ‘Signs of future events are
shown by the gods.’”<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c011'><sup>[225]</sup></a> Unless perchance Ammianus was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>acquainted with the first book only of <cite>De Divinatione</cite>, this
remark—which ought to have proved more potent than any
necromantic spell in invoking Cicero’s slandered Manes—must
be taken as a startling revelation of the mental calibre
of both its maker and his age.</p>

<p class='c010'>Synesius (370–430 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>), Bishop of Ptolemais, furnishes
a good example of what was probably the position of the
average Neo-Platonist who did not go to extremes in the
last period of the Roman Empire. In the present survey
we are not concerned with Christian belief in the Empire,
and so it is only as a Neo-Platonist that Synesius will at
present interest us. He is the more interesting for us in
that he was a man with some taste for science. He knew
some medicine and was well acquainted with geometry and
astronomy, subjects which he probably studied under his
friend Hypatia. He believed himself to be the inventor
of an astrolabe and of a hydroscope. He played his
part in secular politics and as bishop defended his people
from oppression. He was fond of the chase and
of his dogs and horses, and said so. He was a great
lover of books also, but thought that their true use
was to call one’s own mental powers into action. Philosophy,
mathematics and literature all claimed his attention.
Yet broad and independent-minded as he was for his age,
and interested as he was in science, he believed in magic.
Indeed, there was apparently no form of magic in which
he would not have believed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Synesius regarded the universe as a unit and all its parts
as closely correlated. This belief not only led him to maintain,
like Seneca, that whatever had a cause was a sign of
some future event, or to hold with Plotinus that in any
and every object the sage might discern the future of every
other thing, and that the birds themselves, if endowed with
sufficient intelligence, would be able to predict the future by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>observing the movements of human bipeds.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a> It led him
also to the conclusion that the various parts of the universe
were more than passive mirrors in which one might see
the future of the other parts; that they further exerted, by
virtue of the magic sympathy which united all parts of the
universe, a potent active influence over other objects and
occurrences. The wise man might not only predict the
future; he might, to a great extent, control it.</p>

<p class='c012'>For it must be, I think, that of this whole, so joined in sympathy
and in agreement, the parts are closely connected as if
members of a single body. And does not this explain the
spells of the magi? For things, besides being signs of each
other, have magic power over each other. The wise man, then,
is he who knows the relationships of the parts of the universe.
For he draws one object under his control by means of another
object, holding what is at hand as a pledge for what is far
away, and working through sounds and material substances
and forms.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Synesius explained that plants and stones are related by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>bonds of occult sympathy to the gods who are within the
universe and who form a part of it, that plants and stones
have magic power over these gods, and that one may by
means of such material substances attract those deities.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
He evidently believed that it was quite legitimate to control
the processes of nature by invoking demons. His devotion
to divination has been already implied. He regarded it as
among the noblest of human pursuits.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Dreams he viewed
as significant and very useful events. They aided him, he
wrote, in his every-day life, and had upon one occasion
saved him from magic devices against his life.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a> Of course,
he had faith in astrology. The stars were well-nigh ever
present in his thought. In his <cite>Praise of Baldness</cite> he characterized
comets as fatal omens, as harbingers of the worst
public disasters.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a> In <cite>On Providence</cite> he explained the supposed
fact that history repeats itself by the periodical return
to their former positions of the stars which govern
our life.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a> In <cite>On the Gift of an Astrolabe</cite> he declared that
“astronomy” besides being itself a noble science, prepared
men for the diviner mysteries of theology.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c011'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Finally, he
held the view common among students of magic that knowledge
should be esoteric; that its mysteries and marvels
should be confined to the few fitted to receive them and that
they should be expressed in language incomprehensible to
the vulgar crowd.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c011'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Macrobius, who wrote at the beginning of the fifth century
and displayed considerable interest in physical questions
for a person of those days, reinforces the evidence of
Ammianus and of Synesius, although he held no very extreme
views. Unless, however, we except his Philonian
notion that all knowledge may be derived from a few past
writings. For Macrobius affirmed that Virgil contains
practically all man needs to know, and that Cicero’s brief
story of the dream of Scipio was a work second to none
and contained the entire substance of philosophy.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a> Macrobius
also believed that numbers possess occult power. He
dilated at considerable length upon each of those from one
to eight, emphasizing their perfection and far-reaching significance.
He held the good old Pythagorean and Platonic
notions that the world-soul is constructed of number, that
the harmony of celestial bodies is ruled by number, and that
we derive the numerical values proper to musical consonance
from the music of the spheres.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a> He was of the opinion
that to the careful investigator dreams and other striking
occurrences will reveal an occult meaning.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a> As for
astrology, he believed that the stars are signs but not causes
of future events, just as birds by their flight or song reveal
matters of which they themselves are ignorant.<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a> The sun
and planets, though in a way divine, are but material bodies,
and it is not from them but from the world-soul (pure
mind), whence they too come, that the human spirit takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>its origin.<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a> Macrobius also displayed some belief in the
possession of occult properties by objects about us. In the
<cite>Saturnalia</cite>, Disaurius the physician is asked and answers
such questions as why a brass knife stuck in game prevents

</div>

<p class='c009'>Our survey of the Roman Empire and of the ancient
world of thought which it represented is finished. We have
found reason to believe that hatred and dread of “magic,”
the confusion of science or of philosophy with magic,
the incurring of reputations as wizards by men of learning,
were phenomena not confined to the Middle Ages.
We have seen some evidence of the prominence of magic
in the intellectual life of the Roman Empire, in the writings
and in the conduct of physicians and astronomers, of statesmen
and philosophers. Just how prominent magic was one
hesitates to estimate, but one may safely affirm that it was
sufficiently prominent to merit the attention of the student
of those times. It is almost useless to chronicle the events
if we do not understand the spirit of an age.</p>

<p class='c010'>Can the student of that age, we may ask in concluding,
rightly interpret and appreciate it, can he make
proper use of its extant records, unless he recognizes
not merely that men made mistakes then and accepted a
mass of false statements concerning nature, but that the
best minds were liable to be esoteric and mystical, to incline
to the occult and the fantastic, to be befogged by absurd
credulity and by great mental confusion, to be fettered by
habits of childish and romantic reasoning such as occurs
in Ptolemy’s <cite>Tetrabiblos</cite> and in Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>? Have
we a right to attribute to the minds of that age our
definiteness and clarity of thought, our common sense, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>scientific spirit? Is it fair to take the words in which they
expressed their thought and to interpret these according to
our knowledge, our frame of mind; to read into their words
our ideas and discoveries; to rearrange their disconnected
utterances into systems which they were incapable of constructing;
to endeavor by nothing else than a sort of allegorical
interpretation to discover our philosophy, our
science, our ideals in their writings? Have not even words
a greater definiteness and value now than once? When we
translate a passage from an ancient language are we not apt
to transfigure its thought? These are, however, only questions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly there was much true scientific knowledge in the
Roman Empire. There was sane medical theory and practice,
there was a great deal of correct information in regard
to plants, animals and the stars. Science was in the ascendant;
magic was in its latter stages of decay. We flatter
ourselves that it has now quite vanished away; then its doctrines
were accepted only in part or in weakened form by
men of education. Perhaps, though I am far from asserting
this, magic played a less prominent part then in science
and in philosophy than in the later Middle Ages. Perhaps
we may picture to ourselves the minds of men in the twelfth
and thirteenth and succeeding centuries as awakening from
a long, intellectual torpor during the chaotic and dreary
“Dark Ages,” and, eager for knowledge and for mental
occupation, but still inexperienced and rather bewildered,
as snatching without discrimination at whatever came first
to hand of the lore of the past. Thus for a time we might
find the most able men of the later age taking on the worst
characteristics of the earlier time. But this again is mere
speculation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, we must remember that, if magic was accepted
only in part by men of learning in the Roman Empire, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>was no thoroughgoing scepticism. We sought in vain
for an instance of consistent disbelief. If, too, there
was an effort to make the magic, which was accepted, scientific
by basing it upon natural laws, as Quintus Cicero,
Seneca and Ptolemy tried to do, there was also, besides the
definite approval of magical doctrines, often a mystical
tone in the science and philosophy of the time. The
question of the relative strength of magic and of science in
those days must, then, be left unsettled. It is difficult
enough to judge even a single individual; to tell, for instance,
just how superstitious Cato was.</p>

<p class='c010'>In closing we may, however, sum up very briefly those
elements which we selected as combining to give a fairly
faithful picture of the belief in magic which then prevailed
among educated people. Native superstitions from
which science had not yet wholly freed itself; much
fantastical and mystical lore from Oriental nations;
allegorizing and mysticizing in the interpretation of
books—which in Philo went to the length of a belief
that all knowledge could be secured by this means;
a portrayal of nature which attributed to her many magic
properties and caused medicine to be infected with magic
ceremony and to be based to some extent on the principle
of sympathetic magic; a widespread and often extreme belief
in astrology; a speculative philosophy which was often
favorable to the doctrines of magic or even advanced some
itself; and the system of Neo-Platonism in especial, with
which we may associate the view—prevalent long before
Plotinus, however—that everything in the universe is in
close sympathy with everything else and is a sign of coming
events—these were the forces ready at the opening of
the Middle Ages to influence the future.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. My information concerning Michael Scot is mainly derived from
his biography (Edinburgh, 1897) by Rev. J. Wood Brown, who has
studied the manuscript copies of Scot’s works in various European
libraries and has succeeded in dispelling much of the uncertainty which
previously existed concerning the events of Scot’s career and even the
dates of his life. Of Scot’s works the <cite>Physionomia</cite> exists in printed
form; indeed, eighteen editions of it are said to have been issued between
the years 1477 and 1660.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. The part of the manuscript containing the experiment was written
between 1450 and 1500, Brown thinks, but purports to be a copy “from
a very ancient work.” If spurious, its fabricator at least shows considerable
familiarity with Scot’s life. See Brown, pp. 18–19. The recipe
is given in full in the appendix of Brown’s book.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. This view is set forth at length in J. G. Frazer’s <cite>The Golden Bough</cite>
(3 vols., London, 1900). The book also furnishes many illustrations
of the magic of primitive man. Mr. Frazer holds that “religion” supplanted
magic and is in turn itself being supplanted by science. His
definition of religion would probably not be generally accepted.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. Alfred Maury, in the introduction to his <cite>La Magie et l’astrologie
dans l’antiquité et au moyen âge</cite>, (Paris, 1860), expresses a practically
identical view and has the conception of magic gradually fading away
before the advance of science. (See also the article on “Magic” in the
<cite>Encyclopædia Brittanica</cite>, 9th edition.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Maury’s work is not, however, as satisfactory as one is led to think
from reading its introduction. Although he has defined magic almost
in so many words as the attitude of primitive man towards the universe,
he himself interprets magic much more narrowly when he comes to
write his book proper, as indeed its title, <cite>Magic and Astrology</cite>, suggests.
In short the thought that science and magic may at one time have
mingled does not seem to impress him, and his work is of little aid to
one considering our present subject. For instance, he cites Pliny only
as an opponent of magic. Maury’s work, moreover, comprising in its
historical portion but a little over two hundred pages—and these nearly
half filled by foot-notes—can hardly be regarded as more than a brief
narrative sketch of the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>Considerable erudition is displayed in Maury’s references, especially
those to Greek and Roman writers, and from page 208 to 211 Maury
gives a good bibliography of some of the chief secondary works dealing
with magic. More was written upon the subject shortly before his time
than has been since.</p>

“Quamquam et ipsi consensu prope iudicata eligere laboravimus potiusque
curae rerum quam copiae institimus.” In Pliny’s dedication, however,
occurs a sentence which gives one the impression that he felt
rather in duty bound to accept tradition. “Res ardua, vetustis novitatem
dare, novis auctoritatem, obseletis nitorem, obscuris lucem, fastiditis
gratiam, <em>dubiis fidem</em>, omnibus vero naturam et naturae suae

<p class='c010'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. Bk. xxxvii, ch. 40. The word in this passage which I render as
“potion” is in the Latin “veneficium”—a word difficult to translate
owing to its double meaning. “Venenum” signifies a drug or potion
of any sort, and then in a bad sense a drug used to poison or a potion
used to bewitch. In a passage soon to be cited Pliny contrasts “veneficæ
artes” to “magicæ artes” but I doubt if he always preserved such
a distinction. A similar confusion exists in regard to the Greek word
φάρμακον, as Plato sets forth clearly in his <cite>Laws</cite>. There are, he says,
two kinds of poisons employed by men which cannot be clearly distinguished.
One variety injures bodies “according to a natural law.”
“There is also another kind which persuades the more daring class
that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations....” <cite>Laws</cite>,

<p class='c010'><a href='#r113'>113</a>. Vol. i, p. 382. Dr. White’s book, which imputes well-nigh every
fantastic feature of mediæval science to Christian institutions and theology,
is written with too little use of primary sources, and considerable
ignorance of the character of ancient science.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aside from unfairness in the general tone and mode of presentation,—Cosmas
Indicopleustes, for instance, is set forth as a typical representative
of mediæval science of the clerical type, while Albertus Magnus
is not permitted to stand as a representative of “theological” science
at all but is pictured as one inclined to true science who was frightened
into the paths of theology by an ecclesiastical tyranny bitterly hostile
to scientific endeavor—the author makes some inexcusable mistakes
in details. For instance, after speaking of “theological” methods, he
proceeds (vol. i, p. 33): “Hence such contributions as that the basilisk
kills serpents by his breath and men by his glance,” apparently in serene
ignorance of the fact that this statement about the basilisk was a commonplace
of ancient science. Again (vol. i, p. 386) he tells us that in
1163 the Council of Tours and Alexander III “forbade the study of
physics to ecclesiastics, which of course in that age meant the prohibition
of all such scientific studies to the only persons likely to make
them.” On turning to the passage cited we find the prohibition to be
that persons who have vowed to lead a monastic life shall not absent
themselves from their monasteries for the purpose of studying “physica”
(which the context indicates means medicine, not physics), or reading
law. The canon does not apply to all ecclesiastics, and it is as absurd
to infer from it that “all such scientific studies were prohibited to
the only persons likely to make them” as to conclude that henceforth
no one could study civil law. To argue from a single piece of legislation
is hazardous in any case. (For the canon, see Hardouin, vol. vi, pt.
ii, p. 1598. Canon viii.)</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole the book strikes one as an unscientific eulogy of science
and a bigoted attack on bigotry. The inconsistency of the author’s
professions and practice, to say nothing of the somewhat perplexing
arrangement of his material, reminds one of Pliny’s <cite>Natural History</cite>.</p>

not. He tells us (bk. xxx, ch. 2) that some persons have vainly tried
to save Democritus’ reputation by denying that certain works are his.

he believed in its possibility. He affirmed the existence of subordinate
gods, or demons,—interpreters and ambassadors between mankind
and the superior gods, who live far away from us and have no direct
concern with our affairs. The demons, he believed, were susceptible
to human influence and capable of working marvels. He stated that
the art of divination was due to them. See his <cite>De Deo Socratis</cite>.</p>

Delphin edition expresses preference in place of the words “exercendine
autem, anne ostentendi” for the shorter reading “exercendi
autem, non ostentandi”—which reading is adopted by Hertz in his
edition of the year, 1885.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r197'>197</a>. For instance, the charge that astrologers disregard the differing
aspects of the heavens in different regions does not hold true in the
case of Ptolemy. Also the objection to the doctrine of nativities, that
men born at different times often suffer a common fate in battle or
some such general disaster, is a weak argument at best, for the
fact that you and I are born under different stars does not necessitate
that our careers have absolutely nothing in common, and it was nullified
by Ptolemy’s explanation that great general events like earthquakes,
wars, floods and plagues overrule any contradictory destiny
which the constellations may seem to portend for the individual. See
Bouché-Leclercq, <cite>Rev. Hist.</cite>, vol. lxv, p. 268.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f198'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r198'>198</a>. Similarly Favorinus declared that, if the different fate of twins
was to be explained by the fact that after all they are not born at
precisely the same moment, then to determine one’s destiny the time
of his birth and the position of the stars at the same instant must be
measured with an exactness practically impossible. “Atque id velim
etiam, inquit, ut respondeant: si tam parvum atque rapidum est momentum
temporis, in quo homo nascens fatum accipit, ut in eodem illo
puncto, sub eodem circulo coeli, plures simul ad eamdem competentiam
nasci non queant; et si idcirco gemini quoque non eadem vitae sorte
sunt, quoniam non eodem temporis puncto editi sunt; peto, inquit, respondeant,
cursum illum temporis transvolantis, qui vix cogitatione animi
comprehendi potest, quonam pacto aut consulto assequi queant, aut ipsi
perspicere et deprehendere; quum in tam praecipiti dierum noctiumque
vertigine minima momenta ingentes facere dicant mutationes.” <cite>Noctes

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f199'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r199'>199</a>. Favorinus declares that the astrologers may congratulate themselves
that he does not propose such a question to them as that
of astral influence on minute animals; Cicero says that if all animals
are to be subjected to the stars, then inanimate things must be too,
than which nothing could be more absurd.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Illud autem condonare se iis dicebat, quod non id quoque requireret,
si vitae mortisque hominum rerumque humanarum omnium tempus et
ratio et causa in coelo et apud stellas foret, quid de muscis aut vermiculis
aut echinis, multisque aliis minutissimis terra marique animantibus,
dicerent? An ista quoque isdem, quibus homines, legibus nascerentur,
isdemque itidem exstinguerentur.” Aulus Gellius, <cite>Noctes Atticae</cite>, bk.
xiv, ch. 1, sect. 12.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Et si ad rem pertinet, quo modo coelo affecto compositisque sideribus
quodque animal oriatur; valeat id necesse est etiam in rebus
inanimis. Quo quid dici potest absurdius?” <cite>De Divin.</cite>, bk. ii, ch. 47.</p>

<p class='c010'>Favorinus, however, does hint in one place that the sole evidence
that we possess of any influence of the stars upon us is a few such
causal connections as that between the phases of the moon and the
tides of the ocean.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f200'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r200'>200</a>. Ptolemy made a fair retort to this argument by holding that foreknowledge,
even if it could not enable us to avoid the coming event, at
least served the purpose of breaking the news gently and saving us the
more vivid shock which the actual event, if unexpected, would cause
by its raw reality.</p>

Dixi de Pythagora, de Democrite, de Socrate; excepi de antiques
praeter Xenophanem neminem; adiunxi veterem academiam, peripateticos,

“Multi apud eos negantes esse superas potestates in caelo, nec in publico

ephemeride scrupulose sciscitata didicerint, ubi sit verbi gratia signum
Mercurii, vel quotam cancri sideris partem polum discurrens optineat

divination in general—himself cherished a moderate trust in astrology
and was rather satirizing the infidelity of the nobles—their inconsistency
in so minutely ruling their lives by the planets when they
denied the existence of “<span lang="la">superas potestates <em>in caelo</em></span>.” There is an English

smug treatise of a cold-blooded statistician. It is the work of a man who has observed the evils

<p class='c012'>“The book’s hopefulness, its moral earnestness, and its hold upon fundamental
principles, distinguish it among recent writings, bearing on similar educational,
industrial and political issues. It is a thoroughly just and intelligent effort to contribute,
from a standpoint within the life and thought of the South, to democratic
conditions in our Southern States, and the industrial, educational and political
problems are treated as phases of the essential movement towards a genuinely
democratic order.”—<em>The St. Louis Republic.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the courses consist chiefly of lectures; a smaller number take the form of
research under the direction of a professor. In each subject is held at least one seminar
for the training of candidates for the higher degrees. The degrees of <strong>A.M.</strong> and
<strong>Ph.D.</strong> are given to students who fulfil the requirements prescribed by the University
Council. (For particulars, see Columbia University Bulletins of Information, Faculty
of Political Science.) Any person not a candidate for a degree may attend any of
the courses at any time by payment of a proportional fee. Four or five University
<strong>fellowships</strong> of $650 each, the Schiff <strong>fellowship</strong> of $600, the Curtis <strong>fellowship</strong>
of $600, the Garth <strong>fellowship in Political Economy</strong> of $650, and University
<strong>scholarships</strong> of $150 each are awarded to applicants who give evidence of special
fitness to pursue advanced studies. Several prizes of from $50 to $250 are awarded.
The library contains about 360,000 volumes and students have access to other
great collections in the city.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
